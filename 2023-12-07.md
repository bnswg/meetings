Larry Salibra: share market

Don Ruiz: He was having. some audio issues

hank: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: Okay, welcome to Venus working group meeting. So we had two weeks off for doing Thanksgiving. There's also been a Discord group created by some of the BNS council meeting members. I'm not sure I know in the group. I don't think Mark is in the group either. Perhaps we should. Make a way for people to be added to the group.

Don Ruiz: Yeah, we could be great.

Larry Salibra: just I'll see if I can do that.

Larry Salibra: And just before we started recording we talked about I guess Hank is working on sip. And Don talked a little bit. He's working on.

Larry Salibra: Do you want to update people on that?

hank: yeah. Yeah, I mean, let's see regarding the step. 80% of the kind of features are I would say good to go in terms of well specified and I don't see any, potential problems with them being in the Sip in terms of being, very controversial. there are a few that are looking like

hank: decided needs to be made, it's kind of as soon as possible of either figure out kind of what to do next or drop it. so I can bring up some of those basically. Zone file resolution I think is one of the Messier ones. There's a couple ways, to do it, but I think part of the problem is that it adds a lot of Downstream kind of complexity in terms of for example, apps wanting to resolve a big one address that's in there so file, it's like all sort of libraries and apis need to be updated for it. And so my mind it's a question of sort of costs versus reward. I think Larry you're probably the one most sort of familiar with the problem. I'm curious if you have an opinion here.

hank: immuted

Larry Salibra: A friend of mine named his boat you're on mute. during covid So I didn't catch the last part of what you said because I was talking with snazzy about adding people to the working group,…

hank: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: Discord. What was the question for me?

hank: A couple features that we're talking about being, potentially in a sip that are less specified slash more complexity Etc.

Larry Salibra: mmm Yeah.

hank: One of them is the Zone file resolution aspect and so

hank: There's a couple ways that I can think about potentially doing it. I think even just in terms of what goes in the upgrade. It's certainly added complexity kind of from just a high-level design standpoint, but it also adds a lot of complexity Downstream in terms of apis libraries, tooling that even uses it and so

hank: I'm

Larry Salibra: Are you referring to the fact that you can only resolve Zone files to the Legacy that existing contract? Is it?

hank: through Atlas

Larry Salibra: Through Atlas. Okay. I'm remembering of something about putting his own files other places. so it seems like there's two one is working with the blockchain team to make it so that other contracts can use attachments.

hank: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: It seems like that's one thing and then the other thing is the different paths for Zone power resolution, right?

hank: Yeah, and it's a good call. The first part is mandatory assuming we keep using Atlas which I think not doing that with would add a whole lot more complexity and…

Larry Salibra: right

hank: from every indication I've seen it seems like the core team would be very on board with, allowing this new BNS contract to Submit attachments and track them Etc. So that part of Matt.

Larry Salibra: So it would still be a blessed contract despite the fact that you said it is not a blessed country.

hank: I think he's actually been.

Larry Salibra: Why aren't all contracts able to use attachments. That would be my question. And I can admit.

hank: Because it's really just for being us.

Larry Salibra: okay, so you decides would be nice is

00:05:00

Larry Salibra: It just really weird…

hank: I mean

Larry Salibra: because It makes no sense. either you have a feature that all smart projects and using anybody can publish them or you don't That means that just I feel like it's really easy to understand it doesn't make any logical sense. If you're making up a programming platform, And you're saying he's the features we have and you're saying all contracts except for the proof of transfer contract are equal but then you're saying but this one contract is more equal than others. then it's more equal than others. So that's mean, I don't know if we need to go who needs to address that but that seems like patently obvious to me. I mean, maybe it's not obvious to other people why only one you guys build me a nice accent Fun found out about this restriction. which is not

hank:

Larry Salibra: yeah, I mean eventually it says that one else who doesn't have control over the stacks core consensus mechanism can write another BNS contract. So even if all of us except for dude or whoever controls the core team right decide we decided this is the new BNS they do not approve it. It does not work.

hank: Yeah, I mean. I would say that all indications, from Judah he's very against a replacement contract changing the source code of the exact, contract that exists today with the same address,…

Larry Salibra: Yeah, I think everybody.

hank: but Right,…

Larry Salibra: I mean I can't imagine who would be.

hank: but he is supportive of hey, assuming there's some sort of Community approval except essentially that Allowing Alice to use this would be good to go. But that's one question and then say I mean your other point.

Larry Salibra: Okay, so that's one question. Yeah.

hank: I mean Atlas from the start was really just to be an essay and I think that's only ever been what it's intended to be obviously there's a lot of problems with allowing any contract to use it for whatever purpose because it's sort of Adidas vector

Larry Salibra: it's gated by the credits cardigated by the price of stacks transactions, which was that the original when we did we had this back when Three Stacks 2.0 was on Stacks 1.0 right was just on bitcoin and the idea was that you couldn't spam it because Atlas will only take data when you've sent a confirmed conduction where you paid the mining fee.

hank: Mark do you want to say something?

Mark Hendrickson: yes, it's jumping here high level maybe dumb question, but Alice to me feels very Legacy and the sense of It's something that's better off a long time. Very few people understand it even though it exists. I mean I'm working on sexually things for now five years. I don't really understand it still. It's feels like the Subterranean layer of stacks and it's there to support BNS right, but I guess Just throw it out there. is it the way forward it's Atlas something as that General concept Is needed when we needed for certain thing and it can't be not Atlas are there alternatives?

hank: Okay.

Mark Hendrickson: and if we move forward with Atlas is there when I actually make it more about first class citizen with as far as just how we all Use it and…

hank: It's like how we all. and it's just

Mark Hendrickson: understand it because I guess what I hear out, let's come up. I'm just a little bit like my only one.

Larry Salibra: I mean, I know really it's very simple. But I know that it's not been put front and center. I mean, it's simple to the point of being super dumb simple. it just doesn't like you it just has data and the date the different nodes will Gossiply exchange all the data pieces. So you run a stack. So you'll have entire copy of Atlas and the only way to key The only way you put a key in is it's been included in a stacks and the BNS smart contract, but pretty prior to that. It was like there had to be a particular Bitcoin transaction, right they did. It's just a really dumb key value store and I agree. I mean that's really the point is it's either should be a first class edition of Stack smart contracts and anybody's able to use it or maybe it should be there.

Larry Salibra: And I'm not as familiar with conference to our contract. So I would ask what are the storage options? available besides that

hank: Yeah. Yeah, I mean this is something I've explored and ask for example. they allow often data, but their primary way of Setting and their Zone file is just on chain. It's just like smart contract you store some data. You can query it from Smart contracts. It's a little bit more expensive in that sense. you're gonna pay a slightly higher fee or making a sound file update, but there's definitely better guarantees around security kind of like permanence. You could say Obviously the ability like you could then query data from my smart contracts like you could say from a different smart contracts. What is the Bitcoin address of Larry WTC and the result there.

00:10:00

hank: I do really like that approach and that's I think the number one way that if we were going to be making some Alternatives that I would advocate for it's also just like but do we drop Atlas and do we Implement other off chain?

Larry Salibra: just

hank: Capabilities, basically NS supports like you can say either it's on the smart contract or you can say it results on this ipfs, It's all very doable. It's again more of a complexity issue. Potentially. It's something where we could say. Hey we build. The sort of Bones of how this will work within the upgrade. We're not really going to support it with an apps launch. yeah, I mean, this is great because I'm really trying to get a temperature check and it sounds like Yeah,…

Mark Hendrickson: that resonates

hank: sounds like a forum post is needed to really outline this more like I have one,…

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

hank: but I think it's hard for people to grasp. The issue and…

Larry Salibra: Yeah, I see both ways.

hank: so yeah.

Larry Salibra: I get the benefit of the way, does it and I Think there are many good things about that both having the built-in functionality and the ability to say I give us bit torment. Whatever some other hash value sort of thing right where you have data Integrity guarantee, but the other thing just seeing that over the last year the excitement we have seen an ordinals I kind of feel like that Alice is an undersold portion of stacks that I mean, there's economic questions about it. It's kind of fill up like I forget I like it used to be really small.

Mark Hendrickson: small ones

Larry Salibra: It used to be really small like something like

Larry Salibra: I don't know who Justin Henry is the animated. I used to be a really small Zone piles were very small size and my understanding is that that was raised to something like one megabyte and in the current some really big size basically, still theoretically I think there's unbounded but however many potential BNS smart contract updates times the number of updates that fit in one block times one megabyte. I think is the maximum growth rate of Atlas which obviously is pretty fast. but my point was my point being though, is that seeing how once people found how cool stuff to do with Bitcoin once they get just put bigger blocks of data and maybe I feel like this is the same thing and maybe there's a way to have it both ways. maybe I don't know.

Larry Salibra: you split Atlas out and it's still Like you leave it in for now, but then once it becomes a problem you split it out. So you don't have to run a stack Snowden now, let's note I don't know. That's just thinking out loud right now like I would just because it seems like people really like there's a marker for permanent storage right as we've seen now and…

Mark Hendrickson: wait

Larry Salibra: that also you could put jpegs in it people love Jake.

Mark Hendrickson: Sorry interject, but it just seems like there's a key problem with that less just the free loader…

Larry Salibra: You have to pay for you have to pay.

Mark Hendrickson: if we write a problem. It's very different than ordinals because ordinals people are paying directly for that storage. and I just

Larry Salibra: They're not paying well, so that's a question of much debate. Right they're paying to Well,…

Mark Hendrickson: you're paying up front at least.

Larry Salibra: you're paying up front for Alice as well, too. you can't put anything in Outlets without paying a staff transaction fee.

Mark Hendrickson: wait How's that work? You have to pay every time. Yeah.

Larry Salibra: because Every time because what you do is you call the update function and the smart contract and then you upload the new Zone file, right and then that only gets processed if you pay the fee now, I don't know what the algorithm charges of that if that's a fair market rate that I have. No idea I guess it's not Dynamic. It Probably doesn't get into account. I'm just guessing though.

hank: It doesn't at all.

Larry Salibra: I mean, maybe Hank knows how it's priced, but I

00:15:00

Larry Salibra: Yeah, but you still do pay though. You can't run the smart contract without paying.

Mark Hendrickson: discussion So you have to pay the fees of that update function and…

hank: Of course. Yeah.

Larry Salibra: Call the update function.

Mark Hendrickson: that is implicitly paying for the atlas data to be accepted essentially.

Larry Salibra: Yeah, I mean, it's no different you pay the fee for your transaction to be mine. I mean the difference is it's not like that doesn't Scale based on size. That's the difference.

hank: so yeah,…

Larry Salibra: And so maybe it should.

hank: it's like an ordinal transaction where you pay the same thing whether you take so transaction or your posting a four megabyte ordinal

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

Mark Hendrickson: What?

Larry Salibra: I mean it almost seems like something that would be great marketing much have it become a problem and…

Mark Hendrickson: It just seems hopefully complicated though.

Larry Salibra: then fix it.

Larry Salibra: But what do you mean?

Mark Hendrickson: It seems a little bit over the complicated to me like you have. why not?

hank: Okay.

Mark Hendrickson: If that's the case that you're carrying the stacks transaction? Contract call with the deployment of data via Atlas and…

Larry Salibra: Yeah. Because…

Mark Hendrickson: acceptance of it. Why not? Just do it inside of the stack transaction?

Larry Salibra: because the reason is because you don't want to increase the block size how do you explain this? when the contract is run? It's just looking at that the hash is stored in the contract on chain, right? So Atlas is the separate thing. It happens to be in a node, but it could be run separately. so Atlas basically said I will only allow you as a key value store. Right? And so the value is about Zone file and the key is to have something file. Right and then Atlas says I only store keys for which there has been an update Zone file in the BNS smart contract Does that make sense?

Mark Hendrickson: But what's between increasing block size and just increasing?

Larry Salibra: Because It has the same problems increasing the Bitcoin block size. Right? you have to have a ton of storage right? you have higher latency between minors.

Mark Hendrickson: That's for Atlas to function is tell me that.

Larry Salibra: And you don't…

hank: Yeah, I…

Larry Salibra: because you could run it separately.

hank: you can't I mean at the…

Mark Hendrickson:

Larry Salibra: You can't today,…

hank: technically yeah,…

Larry Salibra: but you could without affecting consensus.

hank: I mean, I think you absolutely could I think your peers would probably I don't know…

Larry Salibra: Yes.

hank: how the peer to period later works, but maybe it would be mad at you, propagating. But yeah, yeah, it's 200 megabytes by the way. I'm looking at my own stocks and

Larry Salibra: It's 200 megabytes per update.

hank: total Atlas storage. versus Yeah.

Larry Salibra: okay.

Mark Hendrickson: it seems overly complex for theoretical benefits versus just storing this on June.

Larry Salibra: I mean so. no, I don't think it is at all. I mean, it's the same reason. Look at this way. if you're comparing it to bitcoin, right you can have four megabytes of data per block. using the approach step, right with secret and so this is essentially what Atlas is it's a block size if you wanted to we had Atlas because we basically were able to store more data without increasing the block size of Bitcoin. Right and this in the same way lets you store more data without increasing the block size of stacks. That's why all you need is to Hash in the house.

Mark Hendrickson: but is that actually a problem these days?

Larry Salibra: Okay? Yeah, go ahead.

Mark Hendrickson: if we store this data

Larry Salibra: I mean, it's never a problem until is a problem, right?

Mark Hendrickson: Yeah, but if we want to store all his own file data via blocks today, there's no problem with that.

hank: I would say

Larry Salibra: you have to put a limit right? Just I mean absolutely could be a problem with it. I mean if you start uploading Wizards to it, then you like what it's like it's a size question, right?

hank: Yeah, but you could do that.

Mark Hendrickson: But that's for any usage of stacks, right?

hank: Yeah, you could do that. today it's just a few question, yeah.

hank: Yeah.

Mark Hendrickson: right it all comes back to the economics of it it's any uses of stacks. Whether it's for BNS and Zone files or anything else is going to the same problem. I don't think that means we should sort of shift some of that activity over to a parallel system that works with the stacks block creation system but doesn't store data yet I kind of get the historical reasons for it.

hank: he yeah.

Mark Hendrickson: Now that we have stack some smart contracts. it's like an extra organ that doesn't do much.

Larry Salibra: I get I also would love to hear more. I mean, I'm not married to either I can see interesting uses of it, but I haven't seen anybody actually. Use it interestingly.

hank: quick for example.

Larry Salibra: I think yeah.

hank: I think regular name updates.

hank: It's very solid argument to say to stored on Jane but there's the subdomain, set up where certain Zone files can be. I guess I'm doing but I don't remember. I don't know exactly how big they are. The biggest is but I don't think you can really do that on chain because the way it works is every time there's a new batch update of a subdomains you're posting basically the whole Zone file still replacing the previous one with the new one and

00:20:00

hank: It would basically breaks, subdomain registrared code because you'd have to basically make a full block, or more every transaction. And kind of just saying for really Legacy purposes. We need to have both but it doesn't mean we shouldn't move to this a new on plane setup as well.

Larry Salibra: I had temporarily forgotten about somethings.

hank: Yeah. I'm not a big fan…

Larry Salibra: What's thank you for bringing those up again.

hank: but I don't

Larry Salibra: I'm having flashbacks and PTSD. Are they widely used right now?

hank: I know.

Larry Salibra: At the moment. I mean I assume they're not.

hank: I think there's an app paradigma who is running a subdomain registrar it is issuing subdomains and as users.

Larry Salibra: Okay.

Larry Salibra: Maybe we could propose not having that.

Mark Hendrickson: I think it's my thoughts on Legacy support here. And I don't think we should pull the rug on the apps that have built around that I think that's a good spirit to have…

hank: top ics

Mark Hendrickson: but at the same time moving forward having sort of a different path and say that is true. Like I say we're not gonna expand on that.

Larry Salibra: Yeah, yeah for people that are watching some of the background information on the subdomain register was that feeds are very high back in 2017 registering names and this was a way to basically register many names either to have to let multiple names the one transaction or to let a third party pay for registration. So your app could provide a free name because you're paying for it. And I don't know. It seems to me at least the market has shown us that at least crypto people are only willing they're very interested in paying money for names so that problem I mean, it hasn't gone away for I guess corners, but maybe we don't care about them immediately and the goal is to convert them to become Corners like

hank: Won and also you don't honest your subdomain. You can't trade it, …

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

hank: you're very much at the whim of the domain registrars, they could basically do whatever they want. with your record, and I think your point is right that BNS user is crypto users don't want that type of setup.

Larry Salibra: So maybe that's a separate blog post proposing. The like to simplified it just goes away.

hank: I yeah,…

Larry Salibra: I'm happy to take the heat, okay?

hank: I'm not on board with that. But yeah, okay.

Larry Salibra: Yeah, you're not important.

hank: Okay. Yeah,…

Larry Salibra: You think it's worth supporting for legacy purposes.

hank: I mean.

Larry Salibra: Even in the future maybe a couple years from now or…

hank: onion asked for example coinbase uses set off chain subdivands to …

Larry Salibra: something like this. I'm not saying that tomorrow.

hank: give everyone baseball user like a CB dot ID name and…

Larry Salibra: Yep.

hank: you get the benefit of Basically resolution, so you can type in Hank that cb.id in the wallet and transfer assets or whatever and I think that's a nice thing. You don't have full control over that name, but it's like a sort of entry point. So I don't know, I don't think it's useless.

Larry Salibra: I totally agree. Yeah, I guess I wasn't saying that the concept of subdomains is useless.

hank: But yeah.

Larry Salibra: I think that's very useful. But maybe our particular implementation of it. My understanding from ens was that there's I guess more structured way. I have smart contract functions the ability to Pass a contract the resolves be subdomains and…

hank: Yeah. Now they have medical both…

Larry Salibra: which seems to make a lot more sense than we have.

hank: where you can actually issue an ownable nft subdomain, which is quite a very nice feature. Yeah.

Larry Salibra: but

Larry Salibra: okay. we're running up on time. Is there anything that you wanted to share Be Beyond this or anything any action items need help with. feedback

hank: I think this is really the main one where I'm kind of shaky on what exactly the next step is, but this has been pretty I don't know helpful and just dancing ideas. So. I've got a Next Step there the others.

00:25:00

hank: I don't think weren't as much discussion very least not right now.

Larry Salibra: Okay, I'll try to get people into the Discord group waiting for snazzy to get back to me. and then yeah, that sounds good. Let me go from there.

Mark Hendrickson: Cool is my favorite one yet.

Larry Salibra: Okay.

hank: Yeah, this is the fun stuff.

Mark Hendrickson: I'm glad we got into it.

Larry Salibra: your favorite Yeah.

hank: I agree.

Mark Hendrickson: You doing that?

hank: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: Thanks guys. later

hank: but he

Mark Hendrickson: thanks, just
