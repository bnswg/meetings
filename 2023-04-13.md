# BNSWG 2023-04-13 1430-1500 UTC

**Attendees:** Larry, Hank, Hero G, Ragnar, Jeff, Gina, Philip, Mark Jeftovic plus about ~10 others

## Agenda

- Discuss BNS 2.0 wish list items

## Discussion

We discussed a number of items for BNS 2.0 with Hank so kindly starting off the list with a comprehensive set of items.

Below are some of the items discussed - a complete list will be shared later for discussion

- SIP-9 Compatibility
- Cost efficiency Improvements
- Multiple names per address
- renewal is additive instead
- from the time of expiration instead
- managed namespace improvements
- registration safety improvements
  - required delay between name pre-order and reveal to prevent front-running
  - allow single-transaction registration with a delay before transfers are permitted
- conversion from buffer to string-ascii - better user experience
- zonefile files stored other places besides Atlas
- pricing of names in sbtc
- controller/owner - allow name owners to delegate and revoke control to others
- increased price granularity
- ability earn fees from namespaces
- custom resolver logic either by name or namespace
- improved connections between BNS and L1 names

Of these items, multiple names per address was contentious among some attendees. The current 1 name per address is seen as a spam / squatting reduction mechanism. One counter argument is that it adds complexity to those developing market places and supporting users. It was also pointed out that as the market expands and less technical users join, they may want to use managed services and it might make sense for those services to own all of a customer's names on one address.

One point was raised about competing projects using the same tld. Mark suggested using legacy DNS as a way to assert the official blockchain of a given TLD - to make it harder for imitators

## Action items

- Post this wish list to the BNSWG github for discussion. Hank and Larry will collaborate on this.
