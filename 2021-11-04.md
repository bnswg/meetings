# BNSWG 2021-11-04 1400-1430 UTC

**Attendees:** Gina, Larry, Thomas, Mark, Ken, Alex Gaebe, Eshwari, Ludo, Kyran

## Summary

Given the large number of new people on the call, each person explained why they are interested in BNS and the creation of a BNS working group.

We discussed a few of the potential improvements, the creation of a roadmap for BNS and the benefits and drawbacks of tying BNS tightly to the Stacks node software and upgrade process.

We quickly ran out of time and a suggestion was made that we outline the issues and discuss in writing and come back on a longer call in the future to discuss solutions. This was agreed and Larry and Mark volunteered to take the lead on logistics.

## Action items

- Larry and Mark will work out logistics on 2021-11-05.
