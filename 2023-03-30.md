## Agenda

- Discuss Ragnar's inscription related
- Update from Hank on BNSx
- Update on migration of Stacks 1.0 names

## Inscriptions

- Ragnar gave some background on his thoughts about the possibility of signing inscriptions with BNS names (my notes from the part of the discussion are sparse.)

## BNSx update from Hank

- improvement to name wrapper contract
- renew a name while itâ€™s still on BNSx
- improvements on how easy it is to migrate a name
- thoughts about a SIP for a proper upgrade for BNS
- discussion on hardcoded settings in stacks node which make the current BNS contract a "blessed" contract - other contracts can't store attachments or programmatically operate the BNS contract to store attachments

## Stacks 1.0 name migration from Larry

- has working code in the renewbns.com repo to migrate stacks 1.0 names to the new key derivation path
- waiting on some user feedback for merging to main and promoting to users
- discussed the importance of treating names as peoples' property and making sure they can continue to use them

## Action items

- brainstorm bns 2.0 ideas - Hank will take the lead, others will come with their own and then we will discuss them at next meeting
- send out survey for new recurring time slot - Larry will do this
