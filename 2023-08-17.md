Larry Salibra: Hey everybody. Welcome back to Bns working group. It's been two weeks since the last meeting. so, I think we should I guess catch up on where we are on things. There's been some announcements across the ecosystem with a layer. One name.

Larry Salibra: And also yeah, so I guess Hank, maybe your bigger person to start with …

Hank Stoever: Yeah,…

Larry Salibra: what you've been working on.

Hank Stoever: I've prepared a little demo of where I'm at at the moment. So we had just intro, this is related on the project of bringing Bns names to L1. And so, allowing existing names to be basically bridge over to L1 as inscriptions and they can be transferred, sold whatever. And then if the user wants to, they can also move back to L2 and claim the original Bns name. so, I've got A huge chunk of the project done. So today, I'll demo my local environment. It's just a local blockchain and everything. So nothing's live yet. But I've got sort of, the end to flow going. So I can kind of just demo that So,…

Larry Salibra:

Hank Stoever: let's see, I think I need permissions for the screen share.

Larry Salibra: Okay, I don't know how to do that. We see here. I think we turn those off because of people stealing it last time,…

Hank Stoever: Yeah, that makes sense.

Larry Salibra: let me just figure it out. Go ahead, you should be good now.

Hank Stoever: Can you see my screen?

Larry Salibra: Yep.

Hank Stoever: So we're looking at a local version of the dots app at the moment. This you guys, it's a little bit, just kind of, me getting everything wired up before focusing on the more visual aspect of the design. so, this is the page that you see, when you

Hank Stoever: When Want to move the name to L1. So, I've got this name, Hank, satoshi's that namespace that I use for local development. So the first step is to inscribe your name. So we could do this, for it snippet that you can paste and download or use service like gamma to upload.

Hank Stoever: as you can see, this is actually HTML and it's using technology called Web components. So that the actual inscription when viewed, it's got a nice responsive visual appearance but it's barely any more bites than a very short text. inscription, In fact, like a lot of the JSON ones, it's actually ordered, so you have nice low fees, but still the benefits of something visual

Hank Stoever: And I'll just open This is a little just like Demo page that I've been using to kind of preview it in different aspect ratios and sizes. So you got some sort of responsiveness, it's visual element.

Hank Stoever: Still relatively clean, it looks a lot like the Bns name, kind of like previews that you might see on something like Gamma but it's much smaller. So I've already inscribed it. I've got a Ordinal server, running locally using my local blockchain. This is the source of it. So I'm just copy this ID.

Hank Stoever: Submit it, and then this calling into the contract itself. So it's going to be moving the Bns name into this contract. I'll submit it.

Hank Stoever: and so basically what happened here is the Bns name on stacks was moved into this contract and now the contract.

Hank Stoever: As well as associated APIs have this specific inscription ID associated with this name. So whether using this app or apps like gamma, it's sort of like in Official Bns. Inscription.

Hank Stoever: So, I'll show you now. What? It's like to move back.

00:05:00

Hank Stoever: This is just showing the inscription ID. So, the first step is to transfer the inscription. And so, There's a Deterministically generated burn addressed that's associated with your stats address. So anytime you want to move, one of your inscriptions back to L2, you can use this unique bitcoin address and essentially your stacks address is encoded in this address itself. And so the stacks contract is reconstructing the bitcoin address. Associated with you, in order to verify that this was burned with the intent of moving to your steps address. So I'm going to copy this and then off screen, I'm gonna transfer the Inscription to this address.

Hank Stoever: Second. Just something.

Hank Stoever: It's because Just give me a second, it's because I killed the Ordinal Server. It's just weird at the moment. and I'm gonna restart the ordinal server. It should work correctly.

Hank Stoever: it's a really, figured out. So,

Hank Stoever: I've transferred it. I'm gonna make sure I'm just gonna have that transaction confirmed by mining a new block. And the web apps, sees the transversies that it was moved. And so I need to make a stacked transaction. Now, to claim to Bns name.

Hank Stoever: To do. In a moment. This should Update in the top. Right. So that the name is back in the s address. so now I own the stacks Bns name again. So Go ahead and stop here.

Larry Salibra: One of those crazy at the end, that's really cool. Is it the right time to put on my ordinals hat?

Hank Stoever: Yeah. Thank you.

Hank Stoever: Nice.

Larry Salibra: I'm so the first there was a script tag element is pointing to inscription, is that something you inscribed that …

Hank Stoever: Yeah, and…

Larry Salibra: is a JavaScript script?

Hank Stoever: it's not actually live yet. But that's correct. There's this technique. That people are starting to use a lot now, I think it's called recursive inscriptions, where you're referencing the source of another inscription within an inscription and you can't reference externally hosted things.

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

Hank Stoever: So yeah, that's how the inscription that you upload itself is so small in terms of file size. But, the end result is something that's, much more dynamic. And so, at the moment, it's still just like a static HTML, view, they're technically could be, even interactivity added to it.

Don Ruiz: E.

Hank Stoever: Perhaps something In a few more type of thing where the card flips over and shows some details or something like that. And I'm really open to, any ideas there to kind of make it more Interesting. Whether it's animated things like that. Yeah.

Larry Salibra: How does the stacks node follow the ownership of the ordinal?

Hank Stoever: But this is described in the forum post but for following the ownership there's no method that's been found yet using clarity to track that is the kind of complexity of ordinal theory. So at the moment there is basically an Oracle Server and it's only a testing to given a inscription ID who the current owner is. And so it's kind of dumb in terms of whether it knows whether something's a Bns inscription or anything so could be for other contracts as well but yeah at the moment that's how it works. It's I think certainly

00:10:00

Don Ruiz: E.

Hank Stoever: we obviously want to make this as trustless as possible which is kind of like working within the bounds of what's possible as far as I know. But

Hank Stoever: any improvements here, I think I would be Completely supportive. Make it more trustless across the board. Yeah.

Larry Salibra: Kind of think of other questions people watching the video will ask and ask them.

Mark Hendrickson: I may have missed it from previous meetings, but

Larry Salibra: Good Mark.

Mark Hendrickson: Sorry. I'm curious if we've got into the feedback or about this by so folks outside the stacks, ecosystem more and sort of ordinals land working on domains and we've got their feedback if we kind of know how they think about this whether it seems like Fits with their way of looking at things or not.

Hank Stoever: It's a good question. Not any, very formal context. I mean, I think we also know that there's a lot of, members of kind of ordinals land would prefer a completely L1 based thing where even for Dr. TC that it's minted on L1 and kind of conflicting with Bns state. So I think no matter what there will be some push back there from some individuals and I'm really

Hank Stoever: Yeah, I really want to have this conversations. I think this also comes back to other than just for trading, how it can be used. And so working on APIs and other kind of Dev Tooling so that hopefully in Hero wallet, we can support sending BTC to and L1 based name where it would go to the current owner of the inscription. I think things like that, could help make it much more like I don't know.

Hank Stoever: Legitimate is not the perfect word, but hopefully, know what I mean. Just more utility, more, kind of use cases.

Mark Hendrickson: Yeah, not I definitely recognize the sort of Difficulty of pitching people on bitcoin l2's right now. In general, including it's a challenge. though, why do we need to of course lean into because otherwise we don't want to stay here sort of in a differential realm of thinking and development and just Throwing stuff out and not have it sort of bridge the divide community point of view as well.

Hank Stoever: Yeah.

Mark Hendrickson: And And the wallet debt would love to support based lookups in additional L2. Facebook, lookups. I think those should have parity, essentially, I think if it's gonna help folks who've invested on one side or the other, Move them. Either what L2 or l2l1 and maintain functionality.

Mark Hendrickson: sort of face lower functionality like looking up for sending but then again other functionality based on where they want to move things to then that seems like the rights of General approach to me.

Larry Salibra: I'm I agree with Mark said but if you just looking at this from an L1 perspective so I don't have a stack snowed. I'm interested in trading these? How do I know that any one of these is actually I don't know the Providence of this

Hank Stoever: Yeah. First answer is that I'll be building a very simple tool on dots to look up an inscription or even browse kind of the list of bridge names came on and then number two is working with marketplaces. So working with Gamma at the moment they've been very supportive. Probably, also update the UI that I just showed you to make it more easy basically to plug into Gammas API for their inscription service where if you want to obviously, you don't have to. Will just say transferred X to this bitcoin address and then it'll get inscribed behind the scenes and kind of automatically all go. But yeah that's how you verify.

Larry Salibra: Okay.

Larry Salibra: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'm just curious to this. I mean, it's really a question of social response,…

Hank Stoever: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: You're gonna imagine people saying this is totally ridiculous.

Larry Salibra: we want L1 and this is people trying to chew on their L2 and back into our

00:15:00

Hank Stoever: I think I…

Larry Salibra: I mean, if you were …

Hank Stoever: especially go ahead.

Larry Salibra: okay, I was gonna ask if you were ignoring where we are now, you were to okay, we want to have stopping DC and 01 L2 how would you approach it differently? I mean,' that question were, we are with other names that are on L1 now.

Hank Stoever: Mmm.

Hank Stoever: been like if we could go back in time or just like yeah,

Larry Salibra: Yeah, I mean, just from imagine totally greenfield. Like me.

Hank Stoever: yeah.

Larry Salibra: Theoretically, what would you I mean?

Hank Stoever: I think some way that Names could.

Larry Salibra: I guess it's more of a question of given. We know we can put inscriptions, we can put anything in the description. And how can we best use those from Stacks? LT, or from any help too? I guess it's probably the question and…

Hank Stoever: Yeah. I think finding a way to natively.

Larry Salibra: your experience so far.

Hank Stoever: Register and modify the core Bns contract state from a one directly. So, some mechanism. for example, you can transfer stacks by making a bitcoin transaction and stocks nodes are set to watch, for these specific transaction types and then it updates clarity or stack state without actually making a stacks transaction and doing a mechanism like that for registration transfers, registering and payment in BTC. So, we just had one unified date. Instead of the system bolted in on top to kind of like mesh the two, That seems most ideal to me and kind of gives you the best of both worlds.

Larry Salibra: I mean it seems this is a great Currently now doable solution. It sounds probably the best that we can get. But it seems like that stacks knows really need to add support for ordinals, it really needs. I mean, I don't know. I guess I also been a little bit oversold of this when I first heard don't worry. as a bitcoin node, you can read it, I didn't realize it only can read it regularly, read the bitcoin a very small part of the bitcoin block,…

Hank Stoever: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: I doesn't have read access to the entire block, right?

Hank Stoever: I mean through proofs it does. But it, certainly can't do something as complex as indexing, all sets, And so I think native Clarity functions at the least such as Get owner of inscription by ID.

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

Hank Stoever: Would be, really amazing for this or get the content of an inscription. So, if you needed to verify the content of something that would make it all very like,…

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

Hank Stoever: Very nice completely non-custial. Restless, etc.

Larry Salibra: Any thoughts on?

Don Ruiz: Yeah, I think this is great. I think given that the technology is today and everything that we've talked about thus far, I think that the solution that you've Designed now Hank is, there's obviously going to be some tweaks but it's pretty elegant given what you're doing it in my Opinion. I'm curious about now having this word is obviously there's still some debate going on within the community. What's the next steps in your mind? Are you looking to bring this to a little bit broader audience to get a little bit more feedback on it and…

Hank Stoever: Yeah, one of the hangouts was getting this on testnet…

Don Ruiz: what do you think are the next steps?

Hank Stoever: because there's a stacks test net and a bitcoin test net. That's all wired up and everything. But I've had trouble finding a way to set up an ordinals test net environment without having to run my own testnet node and test ordinal server, even just from a disk and hosting space. It's complicated. But I believe Gamma actually has an environment that they've set up and I'm not sure that it's completely public. so I think that's a potential solution to sort of get this live in it just get in the hands of more people, more than just this demo. and I think also update the forum post with screenshots and maybe screen recording

00:20:00

Hank Stoever: we'll also have this video, just to kind of like, you let people see it as easily as possible, without having to, set up a test net,…

Don Ruiz: All right.

Hank Stoever: this and that

Don Ruiz: I think that's a good idea.

Larry Salibra: Yeah, I agree. I mean, I guess one where I am right now is I think that we've seen in this that there's definite benefits L2 or you can do stuff, it's just really the problem we're running on with L1 is the same problem. Always had a bitcoin it's very complicated to develop anything. and I think going forward is gonna be room for both and if we had more functionality for It's just looking at It's just a couple order of magnitudes easier to add to make an L to do something than it is to make the L1 named do something. And I think that that makes this promising, right.

Larry Salibra: It feels silly that let's move these L,…

Larry Salibra: two names to L ones if you can trade them, which is exactly the opposite of what you think. You'd want to do, right?

Hank Stoever: here, I didn't,…

Hank Stoever: I think, yeah, but the best argument is because you can use native bitcoin so easily on L1, and even with SPTC,…

Larry Salibra: Yeah. Yeah.

Hank Stoever: that'll make the experience much better, but it's still not as clean as just listed for peer having to move back and forth. Yeah.

Larry Salibra: It's cool. It makes sense.

Don Ruiz: I mean this is going to be iterative over time as technology changes and stuff and I feel that when I'm hearing is you're thinking ahead of some of these things Hank in your approach which is great, Larry, as you mentioned, as we get more utility on L1 this type of Solution may not be as important as it is to us today for some of these L1 to transfer over. Right. But as the next phase of this development, I think it's great.

Hank Stoever: Okay.

Larry Salibra: Cool. I'm more running up to our 10,…

Hank Stoever: Peace.

Larry Salibra: which would be 11a pm on time here. so, I'll post the video tomorrow, it takes a few hours to process for In code, and then you can post it on that forum. I guess I'll add it to the bottom of Your thread.

Hank Stoever: Thank That's perfect. Anybody watching, reach out, I'm discord or on the forum. I'd love to hear thoughts, feedback, critical positive whatever.

Larry Salibra: Thanks so much Hank.

Don Ruiz: Thank you.

Larry Salibra: Thank you everybody.

Don Ruiz: Thanks Larry. but,

Hank Stoever: Okay.

Larry Salibra: Yep, no problem. Bye.
