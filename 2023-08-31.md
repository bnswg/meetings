Snazzy 888: Hi Gina.

Snazzy 888: looks like it's just us.

Larry Salibra: No, no Hank is just joining. he joined in disappeared, very

Snazzy 888: I'll get.

Larry Salibra: Everybody, just tell this is being recorded.

Larry Salibra: So I have a one thing I wanted to talk about this week which there was proposal by Chris, from console about starting a dot Btc, gated work group community of Bns Community, which I spoke with him about earlier this week I think some other people have talked with him as well. I personally think it's a great idea. I'd love to hear other people think about that and also, we can open the floor up for updates.

Snazzy 888: Sorry, where is This community.

Larry Salibra: So the app's name is console, I'm not sure. Everybody's familiar with that. Is for fuel watching.

Snazzy 888: Yes.

Larry Salibra: It is a think of it as Web 3 Chat Community app. So it's Black or discord but you use your bns Enos. That's a nice name as your identity as opposed to Using an account on a server.

Snazzy 888: Yeah, yeah. Okay yeah.

Larry Salibra: I think Chris was interested in helping to provide some utility for the names beyond just putting it in your Twitter handle and That sounds like He's each case in my view. Didn't know what?

Hank Stoever: Yeah. I'm supportive of it. I mean it's not as they're like a replacement for bns down discord or other discords. But perhaps could be a place that's more folks around, not necessarily just development of code but development of Sort of.

Hank Stoever: Things we're working on products, etc. And also just as it's almost I mean, rewards not the right word but it's a nice way of kind of utilizing an app that's using Bns to the best extent possible and they've got some other really cool features as well so I think I'd be happy to try.

Snazzy 888: Yeah. Yeah I think it sounds great. Yeah. I mean it's I guess the difficulty as it always is with these sort of new apps that come along. that it's a

Snazzy 888: obviously, it's big biggest, competitor is discord and it's being able to navigate people away from discord. to using console. that's the difficulty because practically every crypto community is on discord, isn't it? So

Snazzy 888: But yeah, sounds like a good idea.

Larry Salibra: Yeah, there's definitely a network effects issues, I think that from slack and telegram to discord also lost a lot of people including myself, I don't really use discord. I'm not ever gonna use it. I've tried. It's not happening. I don't know, maybe a console work. I think it's just for people they're made for different like we end up having.

Snazzy 888: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: I mean here in Hong Kong we have Bitcoin community and we have it spread out over there's sort of Facebook group and then there's a telegram group and then probably someone has discord group. There's signal groups I think you just having communities are organic and they end up spread out over a whole bunch of platforms, and you really can't do anything about that, but I think it'll be like

Larry Salibra: it is functionality interesting to people that have deputy names? Maybe they're craving for functionality and they'll be cool. I definitely want to go use that or maybe we're just speculating on these and really care. I don't know, it'll be kind of interesting experiment to see how much people care.

Snazzy 888: Yeah, That is true. I mean this but I think there's a degree to each both the very much involved, you…

Hank Stoever: Mm-hmm

Snazzy 888: this population element and obviously people wanting to utilize and use, But mean the more utility that comes along the better, which is great. So yeah, I haven't tried console out yet, but I'd love to go over there and try that out. So yeah.

Hank Stoever: Yeah.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Yeah, I think it's great. I use console at least I've logged in creating a little trade in community have invited anyone, but I'd love to chat on there. I'm like with Larry Discord is not for me. I'm on there because I have two and it's painful and I don't like it. And I've had several impersonators over the years on telegram, Twitter, and now on Instagram. So I would love to switch more people on console. So yeah, it's some great little group there. I definitely joined

00:05:00

Larry Salibra: so, the common person really is really great I lost People that follow me on Instagram loss as far as I know, 55,000. So far, I'm visit people that I know about that have lost that much money from impersonating accounts of me. So, I mean, I'm sure, I don't have that many followers, I don't even use Instagram, so, there's a real cost to this, that Other people pay.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Yeah, I've had two people message me and say they actually gave this person Bitcoin because they use one of those scams are like, Hey, I'll send you money back. If you send me this because I have a short fall in your trustworthy guy, I'm a trustworthy guy, me from Twitter and this, and that I felt bad and they both told me that I thought it was suspicious but I know you and it's not. my God. Man. So yeah I Definitely use console someone set up.

Hank Stoever: It's got some other cool. features that actually use cryptography and kind of detect that we're trying to kind of build here, beyond just you're sort of name being actually verified based on the unchained data I think post signed messages and sort of easily verify them against public keys associated with the name and stuff like that so yeah.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: And don't they use Matrix chat for the chat now?

Hank Stoever: Not sure.

Larry Salibra: Yes, they use that.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: They use that on the back end, I guess. But it doesn't seem to be exposed to users. So users don't know. They're using major chat.

Larry Salibra: Does anybody else have any updates? You like the sheriff. So let's do that and I guess I'll catch up with Chris and see what we need to do. As you need to get people into that. And come up with how do we get that people into that community plan? And then Yeah, why don't we updates and see anybody updates like they share?

Hank Stoever: I can go on L1. Project front. There's been a ton of development. I mean, I'd say that. It's basically feature complete. It's in a lot of testing right now. I Had been hoping to have it live on a testnet by now they hang up there being that, it's just pretty difficult to get a whole testnet environment including ordinals, working with Gamma on that they have a sort of environment that they're working to get me access to that, should be usable for others as well. Because again I think it's really important just because obviously to be able to get more eyes on it and testing on it before actually using your

Hank Stoever: real names and locking them in a contract that are etc. So yeah, working with game on that. Hopefully progress soon, I can give an exact date but otherwise I've also bolted in a bunch of, unrelated features to dots that I'm hoping to get live, very soon. One of which is Registration. So it's a pretty simple page where type in a name, choose the namespace and register the difference being. it's all one transaction, very kind of like easy workflow and there's just every namespace is available. So instead of kind of like skipping it just btc or something, just kind of a nice fast shows the price of all these different namespaces and explorations and stuff like that.

Hank Stoever: Also of a search feature, so pretty straightforward, you can find names. And then there's a good name page, you can see more details. And I think the difference there is it's kind of like highlights. All the data you could want versus just on gamma. it's really helpful for seeing what nfts their own and stuff like that. This is more like pure Bns related. So all the metadata and then also there's zone file all split out and stuff. So yeah kind of some tangential features since The L1 work is just a little bit. I'm up on that front. Yeah.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Hank is this the ordinal btc or no names?

00:10:00

Hank Stoever: Yeah.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Have you guys done any more public conversations about it?

Hank Stoever: I mean, just but been going on the Forum.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Just the form.

Snazzy 888: Yeah, was I haven't checked the Forum recently nk. what are the updates regarding that? Any additional? Sort of alterations tweaks be made to the solution.

Hank Stoever: And otherwise basically just what I was laying out Trying to have a testing environment as soon as possible.

Hank Stoever: Yeah.

Snazzy 888:

Larry Salibra: Did you see that? The video that was posted from last week of the demo?

Snazzy 888: Yes. Yes, I did. Yeah, yeah, it was great. It was fantastic. Yeah. Yeah. When do…

Hank Stoever: Thank you.

Snazzy 888: When do you think this potentially might go life Hank.

Hank Stoever: It's hard for me to give an exact Date on the testnet front. Just because it's a little out of my hands. I think it's possible that if by end of next week, that's not live yet then I'll go ahead and roll it out. With.

Hank Stoever: not sort of like Getting it maybe where it's private kind of URL if you want to test it out on mainnet. So you can feel like instead of just pushing out to everyone, we could say Hey you have got a name that you just want to test it with, you can do that behind just some flags saying Hey this is alpha etc, etc.

Snazzy 888: Right. Okay. Okay, bro.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Have you guys talked to any other exchanges besides Gamma?

Snazzy 888: Yeah, I'm currently in touch with Unice App.

Snazzy 888: hopefully I'm hoping we'll be able to put us in touch with the other ones like ordinals wallet and Go the other guys up, ordinals wallet etc. But yeah, I'm in touch with unity. I've been in touch with those guys, for three months now. So

Snazzy 888: It was…

Ragnar Lifthrasir: For the ordinal.

Snazzy 888: because I was in between jobs.

Snazzy 888: I was Sorry.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Sorry. …

Ragnar Lifthrasir: For that Btc. Ordinals, you've been in touch with units at about that.

Snazzy 888: Yes, yeah, yeah. I'm prepared. The. Yeah,…

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Okay, what about Magic? Eden

Snazzy 888: Yeah, that's the other one. Hopefully. Teo Trevor can put us into it with Magic Eden. So yeah, but obviously the biggest in terms of volume is unisa and yeah I'm in touch with those guys.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: The units that would have to support the stacks. Wallet obviously, then All the bns Infrastructure or Run the smart contracts.

Hank Stoever: I think

Snazzy 888: That they support heroin experts, currently, I think.

Hank Stoever: And really what we're looking for is just to have a collection listed, sort of, official Bns names, how everyone call it.

Hank Stoever: So users, it'd be a tough ass to have every exchange say we'll set up the actual bridge, but once it is, you can list it on these different exchanges and have kind of an easy way to search them.

Larry Salibra: Just a question. I'm just take people's temperature. so now that we've seen that the trading volume and FTS and Ordinals has gone down significantly. How would you say this? Affects the need for this functionality you think it was a one time? Because I remember early longer we need to get these so they be As ordinals and now the ordinals the volume is significantly gone down. it's Single digit, millions of us dollar per day or something like that as opposed to whatever it was before. I'm just curious as to what everybody called the views of people in the call is this a temporary thing? Is this going to go back? how does that affect what we're doing?

00:15:00

Snazzy 888: I mean I still think there's demand. For sure, I think and at the end of the day, it's about providing people with choice. And the community wants that option to be able to transfer it over to the old one. and obviously have it on the L2 to utilize the various functionality, that comes with obviously stacks being the application layer and having defiant apps and etc. but yeah, there's definitely still demand. And, the fact that ordinals volume has dropped significantly. I don't think that means that it's Dead or anything. Or, not gonna come back when the bull market starts to get rolling which I believe will probably be next spring summer. Yeah.

Hank Stoever: I mean, I've got no perspective with the trends are going on that front, just, very much not an expertise, but I think, at the very least, even if it never came back, sort of like the demand for ordinal's names, there's a lot to gain from just having a better L1 connection, like Mark from here, a wallet voice support for sending BTC to adapt Btc address if it's on L1. So, all of those kind of, future sets Stay relevant.

Larry Salibra: Cool.

Snazzy 888: Yeah. Agreed.

Larry Salibra: To learn has two questions. Do you want to read those out your app? You can just jump in. If you'd like,

Snazzy 888: so, number one, so, number one,

Snazzy 888: from what I gather, Mr. Nobody's marketplace has

Larry Salibra: Why don't we read it out for people that are there? I'm gonna be watching the call so it's for one is,…

Snazzy 888: yes. Yeah.

Larry Salibra: has it ever heard something again from Mr. Nobody's Plan for our own Bns marketplace. A number two is I always wondered how Dots Cesso will make money. At some points. Mind sharing was actually Hank. no money understand, thanks.

Snazzy 888: Okay, so number one. So I believe Mr. Nobody's marketplace is

Snazzy 888: It has kind of stalled, I think they pretty much ran out funds. That's what I gather the situation is that they've just run out of room, yeah, which is pretty unfortunate. Really because obviously, we were all looking forward to the marketplace And it was spoken about gosh, four, five months ago now, so I think that's the status is that it's been stalled.

Hank Stoever: number two. I don't have an exact plan in December. do X and that'll have why the goal has really been that.

Hank Stoever: really just trying to bolster Bns overall and provide a lot of active development to try and get it to a better place so that it can eventually end up I think there's a couple different options like one for example is around registration. I could imagine a couple different flows where just hypothetically There's a feature where you could register name with BTC and we provide some sort of feature kind of like inscription services, Maybe take a little fee off the top, while doing this on the back end that's just a hypothetical example but it's still in the face of trying to

Hank Stoever: a kind of make dots a bigger thing in the Bns community, I don't think it's quite there yet and then number two, just Providing the utility overall to be able to harness it, in a better. Environment. right now, it's not a bull market for names or for anything. And so I think the ROI is better kind of for long term, Foundational building. And then finally, I'm just a member of the stacks community and stacks myself and at paganism and so there's a good incentive just to provide utility for stacks overall. And so, I'm not trying to say that's the only plan, but it's not like I get nothing out of Stacks, Growing.

Snazzy 888: So, you're a volunteer like the rest of us Surviving.

00:20:00

Hank Stoever: I guess that I would have, put it that well I'm but I guess.

Snazzy 888: Yeah, so basically you don't make money from dots.

Hank Stoever: That's correct. Yeah, that's correct.

Larry Salibra: We have about a couple minutes left. Anybody else want to raise any topics?

Snazzy 888: I mean I would probably mention something but I don't know whether I'm allowed to with Don and Gina present. But it has to do with a part with up,…

Larry Salibra: If you do whatever you want,

Snazzy 888: has to do with partnerships dogs. but yeah, Things are wrong going in that respect that they're taking time on The UD from unstoppable. Domains from so, Yeah. I think most of the community are, in Agreeance that this would be a fantastic thing for Bns and Stacks and then I think obviously there are a few people that perhaps against it. Because of how I don't know, sort of people perceive Ud as being very centralized, so,

Larry Salibra:

Larry Salibra: People they go around suing everybody. I don't.

Snazzy 888: It happened once and…

Larry Salibra: Record video.

Snazzy 888: and it's everyone now. Yeah. No,…

Larry Salibra: okay, I don't know. I just heard it from community.

Snazzy 888: no, yeah. Yeah no. I mean I don't know kind of the circumstances of that but I think it's pretty irrelevant. Really it kind of at the end of the day it's about bns and stacks adoption which I believe. this will be Huge for Bns tax adoption, this UD partnership. so yeah. We're hopefully going to be coming up with some sort of solution, I think in the near future. Yeah that's all I can say.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: How come you guys aren't doing this in public?

Larry Salibra: They don't want to get to see.

Snazzy 888: Because, Because we've got to adhere to an NDA myself and Tommy. So this is why we can't kind of be. Incredibly transparent about all of this. so we've got to adhere to an NDA. So we can't break them.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: I know it's an open source Public ma Permission lists. So when I hear about deals being done with ndas that affect a lot of people with big money, especially from, unstoppable, domains who just applied. We have a really bad reputation. It concerns me So, just something to consider.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Yeah. Yeah, I would never sign an NDA unless I'm trying to think of a reason to be really tough, especially if I'm Deciding that I'm going to be making impactful decisions on something like an open source protocol and people's name, they can greatly affect the value and utility of what they're doing. So I'd strongly encourage you guys to Not do without.

Larry Salibra: Yeah, unless they're paying you money. I hope you're not signing any NDA. We're not getting paid money because that's the only time you should be signing 888.

Snazzy 888: So, I mean, I can't discuss the ins and outs, but Yeah, there's nothing sort of untoward about it's just a formal legal,…

Hank Stoever: I,

Snazzy 888: legal procedure, and we have to sort of maintain the confidentiality of the terms of the partnership. so,

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Who are the entities that are signing the ndas is that unstoppable?

Hank Stoever: it's like,

Ragnar Lifthrasir: What remains and who else?

Snazzy 888: the Bns council is myself and Tommy. Yeah.

Hank Stoever: And I mean I think Ragnar to your point it's an open source protocol but as long as some sort of private deals, aren't affecting the protocol directly, it's anyone's right to do whatever they want. However they want, terms of whether

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Yeah, people can do whatever I mean,…

Snazzy 888: This is it.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: should though, doesn't mean they should just because they can and it seems like I've seen the Bns Council seeming to try to represent.

Hank Stoever: It's her.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: I don't know, I'm just really uncomfortable with doing something as powerful as unstoppable, domains who has such a bad reputation.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: At least disclosed, what your profit is or anything you can. I mean, we're supposed to be building in the open, I understand this private companies. Obviously, I'm an entrepreneur,…

Hank Stoever: One.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: I'm my own company and so I'm aware of, how business works, but it's quite concerning.

00:25:00

Snazzy 888: I mean it's concerning to you Ragnar. let's not kind of try to sort of encompass everyone in terms of what you're saying here. But yeah, I mean yes Ud is probably kind of like the equivalent of Godaddy, the Web 3 but in crypto, some of the largest companies are all centralized, Binance Coinbase and ultimately they have just brought this huge wage of weight wave of adoption to Crypto and Ud will be the same. so

Snazzy 888: we're acting in the best interest for the community. So we wouldn't do anything that would not

Ragnar Lifthrasir: How could you say you're acting in the best interest of the community? When You're doing this, with an NDA, and you're not saying what you're doing and by the way, there is no community, Sometimes I say this and we all say Be community, but there is no community. We're all better, very heterogeneous group with just uses. We're just users of software, and we're not a community. So I don't represent any community. You don't know one does, but It's just users of software. So I think we're gonna be careful with that. But hey, I can't stop it from doing that. It's just very, very concerning.

Snazzy 888: You might not be part of the community but I'm part of a community. there's 1700 of us in this community. And, we have a Bns council for a reason. Yeah, we've been elected, a sort of a democratic fashion to be able to make decisions, some decisions, obviously on behalf of the community, some in sort of consultation with the community. So, once hopefully things have been finalized with ut. Yes. Then we can have some form of Console takes tip approach approach if you like with the Bns community. But, ultimately this would be a fantastic thing. the Bns Council have spoke about it in length. Obviously when we have not

Snazzy 888: Are around the area anything but this would be a fantastic opportunity for Bns and for stacks for its long-term, adoption and growth.

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Hold on. Craig, The Bns Council doesn't represent Bns users. You guys are It's just a discord group. It is an account for Bns users and I think we should be very clear about that that your community is a discord server. There is no Bns account for Bns is an open source thing again.

Larry Salibra: I'm sorry Ragnar. So I don't like Can I jump in?

Ragnar Lifthrasir: Yeah. Go ahead. Larry

Larry Salibra: We're getting up at the time limit here. I just want to be respectful People's time. I mean I share renders concerned but also I think that the Bns Council is doing what they think it's best and there's nothing I mean ultimately

Larry Salibra: I mean I would not go about it in that way but that's fine. I'm not doing it. So I mean I'm generally a trusting person. I think that there probably operating good stage and trying to do it anything's fast and ultimately since because of the decentralized nature of the technology and a community, we're gonna be able to like once whatever they decide to comes out, We'll be able to say, okay, this is either good or bad and we can rally the troops as we do in Bitcoin. And either way and say we think this is good, we think this is bad and I think it's like until we know what they're working on. I mean they could be planning up like a holiday party, I don't think it's worth us getting

Ragnar Lifthrasir: They're not planning a holiday party. Doesn't really.

Larry Salibra: I hope we get invited if they are

Ragnar Lifthrasir: It's really disturbing. I'm kind of shocked. That's the way things are being done. But hey, people have their financial interests and those are often put first

Larry Salibra: Yeah I agree with you Ragnar's Walter. I think probably better to open my house.

Snazzy 888: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: Will haven't looked into it a lot so I don't know. I just heard rumors about the organization and So we have to provide an alternative ultimately to unstoppable domains. if they're bothered about it, then our solution is to get dots dot s. So it's really popular, right? And then that removes their competition is the way to approach that.

Snazzy 888: But also working together and working collaborative collaboratively with other entities, Ud, Because that absolutely huge Ensa recently partnered with them as have many other naming systems So, it makes absolute sense for Bns to also be part of that partnership to also be part of this Web 3 alliance as well. Which is going to be formed very soon. and ultimately everyone wins at the end of the day and that's what we want, isn't it? We want increased adoption for Bns and the stacks. so, we want more people to onboard on into the stacks ecosystem. so everyone wins everyone benefits from this ultimately,

00:30:00

Ragnar Lifthrasir: I feel so great. Then why do you have to sign an NDA? Why do things in secret? If you think it's great, why not say what you guys are doing? Put it out there, do Twitter spaces, do a stacks form and see what people actually say, rather than It's been after. The fact tell people Trust us it's great. We can tell you what we're doing…

Snazzy 888: Yeah. We?

Ragnar Lifthrasir: but it's great. That's what I don't understand.

Snazzy 888: We have to sign an NDA because they are a legal company. they are an actual company.

Larry Salibra: That's total, okay, I'm sorry I'm sorry. I don't make anybody sign in case. Here,…

Snazzy 888: They wouldn't want it to be put the things that they're sharing with us,…

Larry Salibra: works for company.

Snazzy 888: they wouldn't want us to disclose that publicly and then for people to plant them or…

Larry Salibra: That's very worrying,…

Snazzy 888: whatever forums or…Twitter or whatever.

Phillip.xck.app: that's the one that we are using in order to have Internet ability between blockchains So we're using that already,…

Hank Stoever: I,

Phillip.xck.app: there has a kind of a reputation good or bad, but it has it working. And so we're using that as a way to Connect the IDs using the idea, the AD Web protocol because that's a way to facilitate right now. The way that to authenticate users but also, as I mentioned some weeks ago, we are integrating that having different levels of authentication. And the one that I mentioned that…

Larry Salibra: I'm sorry just about the topic we're talking about.

Phillip.xck.app: if you Button.

Larry Salibra: I'm confused. Are you talking about something separate from this partnership?

Phillip.xck.app: Yeah. That I can,…

Larry Salibra: I don't.

Phillip.xck.app: I will use the idea where the protocol and another politicate, So then I used to can have their Digital wallet and the stacked wallet or whatever so they can create using the IDE profile there their password on. So they can use the open ID connect protocol and

Larry Salibra: Okay, I'm sorry. I feel like you jumped in and sort of change the topic like we're actually Over time. So,

Phillip.xck.app: Yeah, the thing is that I've been try to connect To understand. I've been, working with the Bns so long, And then I'm not doing the exchange business. So yeah in fact just using it in order to solve a real problems that the world has and one of the big problems is identities and identity. Let's say stealing or replacement and something some people using that I'm trying to use that and that's a way to solve the problem. and that's why I use the Bns as a data point for that. And I'm not so much involved in exchanges, And so, then,

Phillip.xck.app: that's my comment.

Hank Stoever:

Snazzy 888: Thank you, question.

Hank Stoever: I gotta get going.

Hank Stoever: But, I mean, I understand the concerns on both sides. It's like, statues, trying to just, I don't increase adoption and integrations and I think details are kind of like, whether that's out, good or bad. But I mean, ultimately, unless, they're asking me for time or money, I just feel like it's kind of anyone's right to go wherever they want, I work on, things to try and improve bns. That I don't know, I'm sort of the moron, I think freedom of action on that front but yeah, I got a hub look forward to seeing you on console.

00:35:00

Larry Salibra: I gotta run to you guys. We got a typhoon coming here and I want to go up finish tidying up before we get blown away. Okay. Thanks,…

Snazzy 888: Real, great, great. See you all great.

Hank Stoever: Talk later. Good.

Snazzy 888: Great. Hank.

Larry Salibra: good to see you.

Snazzy 888: which is like,

Meeting ended after 00:35:20 👋
