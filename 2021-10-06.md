## Summary

There is general interest in improving BNS so that it can be more widely used in the ecosystem and enable new business models. We want to involve in more stakeholders.

## Agenda

1. Intro: How you plan to use BNS, your interest in this working group
2. BNS’s position in the stacks ecosystem: traditionally it has been part of the blockchain. Should this continue or should it be separate project built on top of it?
3. When/How should we engage more community members?
   1. Should this be done via the Stacks foundation or separate org?
4. Ideas for near-term improvements to BNS
   1. Reverting previous hard fork changes to BNS:
      1. Solving issue 37 (1 principal can own multiple names) for Stacks 2.1
      2. paying namespace creators instead of burning funds
   2. Updating BNS to support SIP-009 NFT Standard
   3. Marvin’s BNSv3
