# BNSWG 2021-11-05 1330-1430 UTC

**Attendees:** Mark, Larry

## Summary

In order to encourage contribution, each person in the BNSWG needs to own an initiative. These initiatives will be tracked and discussed on [Github](https://github.com/bnswg/initiatives).

Members will be responsible for promoting/selling their initiatives to the wider community through content they produce.

We'll plan to have at least one monthly recurring call, the appropriate length of which will be determined in the future.

## Action items

- Mark will write up a README document proposal outlining logistics and how the group will operate.
- Larry will create initiatives to kick off discussion around the current potentials initiatives raised by members of the group.
