Tommy Butcher: Looks that way.

Larry Salibra: No everybody. Welcome to at this last edition for 2023 of The Bns Working Group. Yeah, I don't.

Snazzy: Blue.

Larry Salibra: I don't know what's up with Ragnar. I haven't talked to him. Somebody just asked in the chat. That's a good question. Someone could pay him maybe and see if he wants to join. I know people were traveling about a month ago so the one previous there's a lot of things become Miami, but I don't know what he's been up to since then. Gina.

Snazzy: Hi Gina.

Tommy Butcher: Hey, Gina.

Larry Salibra: Okay why don't I just so first off Hank is not gonna build to make it today and why don't I just share is update from him? He's working on. So last time we were here, we talked about, I think the takeaway was that we need to get some sort of better feedback from the community about what should be in a Bns 2.0 and what shouldn't be answered our discussion about what that feedback speed and what are the questions and how it should be done. And so, Hank volunteer to create an app. So we can do some sort of voting

Larry Salibra: In some mechanism. not just necessarily like something like What the change would be which is to get an idea of okay, this is what people are thinking. I'm on various features because there are some that seem to be non controversial and some to seem to be very controversial. But it's really hard to tell what I'll do that is, so he messes me to say you wouldn't be here and that he's been working on an app about that. so I think we should expect to see an update from him next week,

Snazzy: He?

Larry Salibra: but the way it works is that users can vote by signing with their stacks wallet. In the data will be public. So that's update from Hank.

Tommy Butcher: Awesome.

Snazzy: okay,

Larry Salibra: and is anybody Have any other topics they'd like to discuss this week? Not to have much prepared.

Cordy Joseph: Yes, so I stand up for the BT, accelerator thing that's going on, so I got into that. I'm excited for it.

Larry Salibra: Congratulations.

Cordy Joseph: And I'm hoping to see what app I could build around Bns or just domains in general. It's important. And with me, my main thing is this having the way to connect it with about tokens. And Zeke proofs and seeing how that could work it in that kind of way.

Larry Salibra: And what would you be interested in having that do what the functionality be?

Cordy Joseph: So for me, it's just about something watching what's happening with this project from Nike called that Swoosh.

Cordy Joseph: Because that's what they're able to basically. So the whole power of domain is that it's able to be in trouble within many apps. So, it doesn't matter what chain you're using or what side you're using. Just with Spotify and how much shopify that would say implement Ens onto their website and if your user you could have DNS under. So, the whole thing about these domain is that you can literally have them in platform. It doesn't matter blockchain. So that's the killer use case right there. So I'm staying with Death Wish, when I think they have these desks with domain, right? And they currently work with fortnight. So that means that. So recently, I wouldn't connect that's what's name, which is like some random digit, that's what to my epic games account, And because of that to get it so bad So how can we give in the future for future?

Larry Salibra: Okay, So it's sort of like a marketing thing.

Cordy Joseph: Yeah. So it's basically a way to give people web access without having to really think about what three in a way, So basically it's like a login, if you think about domains the way to log into different apps, what that being too technical about where three because, how you could sign it with Google or sign with Facebook, so it's think like they're really gonna make it May street. hey I'm standing with Bns that's it but you kind of don't know it's really like a blockchain kind of app. We just selling it with the Bns name and it connects to any app anywhere and that's a very good use case and I might and the reason why I want to connect things like Zeke proof that either way to get people. it's privacy in general because if you think about this, a lot of solution, you still have a problem with data and it can track and expect your AI but if you add CK proof to it. We're okay. Now my data is private, you can't tell what it is coming from. So now you have a way to private data.

00:05:00

Larry Salibra: but,

Snazzy: Yeah, I'm I mean, upset, I hadn't watched The previous video Larry. So apologies, if there's an overlap here but I just put it a little agenda in the sort of messages with regards to Bnsb V2, what sort of ETA are we looking at With regards to that upgrade, or is There are sort of an ETA or kind of a rough sort of date range. Maybe.

Larry Salibra: I mean, I don't know there's a immediate ETA. I think that the next step is to get a view of what people want, and that's the idea of devoting out that the things working I was supposed to connect with him this past week and I failed to that. So I'll reach out to them the next week and sort of see where he is in that. I mean, I guess I didn't realize he was going to build a whole app around this. I thought I was gonna be a very quick way to just get some feedback simpler the better. I don't want to go as possible and say, over rotate on this. I think,…

Snazzy: Is.

Larry Salibra: idea of what people want, what they don't. And that way we can point to some, I don't see objective but concrete A million names voted for this. two of them voted against it. So maybe you two don't really want this but I'm really names on it so I don't know the community that means…

Snazzy: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: but just as opposed to just a few people making decisions. that's what he and I would like to Start a simplify that if yeah. So maybe I'll try to connect with Hank. This to me, we can see what you're working on to see if we can make it less work, and get something out there quicker on. But I think that that is just to …

Snazzy: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: okay, which of these features go into a rewrite basically,

Snazzy: Yeah. I mean because to yourself and Hank. Are you sort of both pretty dedicated to Bns development? Or do you both really kind of have other things that you're working on and then Bns is kind of a bit of a side projects or thing up? I'm just trying to understand the development sort of position,…

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

Snazzy: with regards to Bns

Larry Salibra: Yeah, I mean I don't want to I mean, my understanding is that mechanism is fully dedicated, which is Hank and Jeff's company fully dedicated to Bns. I mean, it's sort of a side project for me. I'm investing in some other things at the moment. I mean hoping to build a top of it but it's not like something. I'm working on 24 hours today. that helps

Snazzy: Yeah. because I think maybe this is something I think perhaps for us to look in and look into maybe in the future or near future is, having sort of dedicated sort of developers, not say that you and Hank aren't dedicated because you're absolutely have to Bns. But in order to be able to sort of move us forward within. sort of a ample amount of sort of time if you like, because I guess this is one of the things I guess that competitors, inverter covers naming systems, L1 based naming systems is that they have dedicated teams, working on the development progressing, their projects and I think that's

Snazzy: yeah, just one of the things that I very much become more sort of consciously aware of over the last two to three months, is that, I almost feel like Bns really needs to have kind of her more developers, I think maybe working on it, in order for us to be able to roll out things maybe quicker and I guess also amount there's a decentralized element to it. kind of also means that we have to reach sort of consensus on various issues and things and there's a bit of red tape bureaucracy that, sort of slows us down a little bit compared to these, businesses, maybe I don't know. I'm just sort of Brain farting.

Larry Salibra: No, you're totally the same here, but and I've been saying for a couple years now, but it's always the question. Okay. you're more than welcome to do it. Thank you.

Snazzy: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: You found them. I mean, and so, it's kind of been a collective action problem Jeff and…

00:10:00

Snazzy: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: Hank came out a couple few months ago, It's okay. We're trying to be like the Bns people. So you're the Bns people. That means Okay, So where's the Bns, So I mean I don't know. And then mean I don't want to say that. I mean then and there's been various companies in the ecosystem that I'm sort of like either come out publicly and said they're working on it or Through the back channels you've heard, they're gonna put a bunch of money into it. It Hazard has materialized. I think I'm luck less car. We talked a lot, I don't remember who exactly is here, but one of the questions was collecting fees from domain sales and having a pot of money, right at Dow or whatever. and definitely the benefit of that. I'd like the question is Who's gonna hold the money? And I've raised my hands and I don't want to deal with the regulatory.

Snazzy: Move. Yeah. Yeah.

Larry Salibra: So someone needs to step up to do it. And, …

Snazzy: Mmm.

Larry Salibra: it happens happy to facilitate in terms of what people, opinions or I don't know, get people together, but in terms of creating a pot of money, I mean, it was The original pitch for stacks was that, why does taxi in token, and the values gonna be like people are gonna register names. They're gonna burn these tokens, And then the whole platform of sort of switched, right? So it's very hard for stacks to capture the value from Bns in that wasn't getting

Snazzy: Yeah. Yeah, I mean I think. and maybe I'm sort of perhaps making this up, but I'm not too sure, but I sort of get the feeling and this was going back to a tweet that Jude made. A couple of months ago. where he's what?

Larry Salibra: I'm blocked so I couldn't see it.

Snazzy: He said that Bns was just at all and a bit of code. and then I replied to him with my info underscore Bns accounts, not with the Bns tower counter the time. And I said, Dude there's a dedicated community here of 1700 people. This is more than just a tool code.

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

Snazzy: You've actually got people that have a vested interest in DNS and…

Larry Salibra: Yes.

Snazzy: in its growth and development. So I think I almost feel like that's

Snazzy: That's something There's been a pivotal change happen. I think. Since the end of last year, where Bns is far more than a tool and carried. there's actually a fully closed community behind it.

Larry Salibra: Absolutely.

Cordy Joseph: Yep.

Snazzy: and I sort of feel like we need People in the leadership positions. Let's say, within stacks to sort of say it that way and to dedicate some funding towards Bns and just cause its development and I think Tommy's sort of feels the same as me, I actually think the Bns could be a real driver for stacks growth. In the near future,…

Larry Salibra: Is it?

Cordy Joseph: Yeah. just,

Snazzy: especially through this UD partnership. it could really help to sell it accelerate growth and adoption for the network. and,…

Tommy Butcher: And I found snacks.

Snazzy: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

Larry Salibra: Yeah, but I think I'm totally totally on board with you. I agree 100%. So I think that the question is what is the action? To do this, and I mean I think Gina was a good person that starts trust machines, They've raised a ton of money and I know that they're there. They've been Dabbling on investing and Bns in various ways, at least from what I've heard. I don't know what the currents with their data is that I haven't talked to her. what I want for a few months now. So Perhaps it's a good step at least for me since I know a lot of the characters would be to connect with all of them and see what exactly is going on here. what is your organization's commitment to Bns?

Larry Salibra: And if it is something great how come we don't know about it or if it's nothing. how do we get a commitment to Bns and then start to think about what sort of structure could be behind that? I don't think that there's been talk about a Stack Foundation grants and it seems like there needs to be some sort of degree of autonomy. hearing sister be, I mean, I don't want to say a foundation for Bns but Something at least,…

Snazzy: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: a couple people working together and that's their full-time. Sort of thing. pushing this forward, maybe they're not doing the development but maybe they're at least coordinating. Or thing.

Snazzy: Yeah, absolutely. I mean so I wouldn't download divorce any conversations, but I've been speaking to Mitchell from Stax Foundation. So, I just had a number of questions to ask him, but from what I gather with regards to the grant making sort of system if you like it's very much good around. the development of very specific things, and

00:15:00

Snazzy: Is quite narrative, feels quite narrow. there's not much of a kind of I don't know, maybe not SPONTANEATE, there's maybe not spontaneity, but there doesn't seem to be much of a sort of Sort of elements to the funding sort of procedure. and Bns I think is a prime example, We have this fantastic community behind us, I think we need to start really accelerating the development with Bns. I think there's so much potential there. the leadership in stacks just as I say, don't seem to see it and

Snazzy: Yeah, maybe myself and maybe Tommy as well. we need to come up with some sort of proposal and we need to have a video call with and with yourself as well maybe Larry and Hank, we need to have a video call with the people This sort of leadership side let's say in stocks and also with Mitchell as well on the Stacks Foundation and we need to say, Look I think we need to have, little dedicated part of funding here to go towards the development of Bns. Because actually this is going to be An amazing driver for growth of the Stax network, we need to have your attention here with regards to this.

Snazzy: And also, as well you mentioned Treasury as well. Larry so I did mention this to Mitchell, I need and he said, That, it's something that they would be potentially open to managing the stacks foundation would potentially manage the Treasury. So yeah, he just said, just draw up a document, a proposal submit it. and then we'll sort of consider things but I definitely do think. Yeah. And you probably might agree with me on this. I think we need to have, face to face conversation with the stacks of leadership. And, just to say, Look, I think we need to start dedicating, a small part fullness towards the development of Bns because I feel anyway, fundamentally important. The stack's growth in the coming years.

Tommy Butcher: Yeah, it would be good to at least know, On their CL. where do we fall in importance? And do they understand that? As Bns has grown. This is an entry point for people into stacks. I mean again that's how I found sex. I have never found stats. Would have never bought Stx. If I wasn't trying to buy Adopt BTC domain and I was trying to buy BTC domain because I had, gone down the other path, EDI ens all that. And I found, Of course I want that. How do I get that? And it was an entry point in success. I think more and more as this community has grown.

Tommy Butcher: That's been an entry point to stacks, and it almost feels like, sex doesn't quite understand that yet. Or doesn't see that as as Bns gets more marketing as partnerships happen as things like that happen. This is a Really good entry point for people to get into stacks. And I don't know if they quite See it that way yet. Maybe they still see Bns as Bns a year or two years however, long ago where it was just a tool and it's a lot more now,

Snazzy: Yeah. I feel,…

Cordy Joseph: Yeah, it's interesting Cincinnati.

Snazzy: I'm sorry, Cody.

Cordy Joseph: Yes like I said before with fortnite it shows you how it could connect any website any app that you can find so that the use case of bringing mass adoption to stacks, it's possible using Bns That means that anybody who works with Bns or able to partner with us to have sex could eventually have to stacks account if I haven't bns? So it shows you the possibilities and the question I have is how much money do we have for Bns possible funding? Because I do know it team of devs that I wanted to help out, but I'm not sure how much funding is there to support to be in this ecosystem.

Snazzy: But yeah,…

Tommy Butcher: I think it's zero.

Snazzy: zero. Yeah,…

Cordy Joseph: Man.

Snazzy: Zero women.

Larry Salibra: How much are you investing?

Snazzy: This is yeah.

Tommy Butcher: I mean,…

Snazzy: This is the fundamental problem.

Tommy Butcher: as he, yes, Snazzy. And I have been trying to work a deal and that's actually what's holding it up? It's funny. it would Immediately. Blow up Bns. I mean, I can't talk about all the details of it but it'd be huge and that's where we're stuck is. The funding part.

00:20:00

Snazzy: Yeah. Yeah.

Larry Salibra: The funding to get something done or I mean can you tell if you share more everybody or not? But here.

Cordy Joseph: Yeah. …

Tommy Butcher: .

Larry Salibra: Yeah, good.

Cordy Joseph: that's a built affirmation. Tell me my best poison.

Tommy Butcher: I mean. we can say that there's this ongoing or possible partnership with the Web 3 alliance with UD. and that would open up a lot of opportunities for Bns to be On multiple wallets, multiple exchanges, things like that. That's about as far as I think standing we can really go Without.

Snazzy: Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

Tommy Butcher: Breaking the NON-COMPET or the NDA that we signed.

Snazzy: Yeah. yeah, I mean there's plastered on Twitter a little bit…

Tommy Butcher: Would be.

Snazzy: but yeah,…

Tommy Butcher: Yeah.

Snazzy: I mean it involves partnerships and integrations s in essence with wallets So,…

Tommy Butcher: yeah, lots of

Snazzy: and and that have millions of users, so we're not just talking about small kind of,…

Larry Salibra: Right.

Snazzy: crypto wallets here. We're talking about the big guns,

Larry Salibra: That's right, I of this but the question though was like you said, you're stuck on funding, So that means You need to raise funding for this to go forward or you need what aspect of funding. I didn't understand the comments when you say you're stuck on funding.

Snazzy: In essence, I think what? Yeah, Cordy obviously was saying he was trying to work out whether we sort of receive I guess sort of funding for the development, for Bns specifically and I imagine maybe yourself Larry and obviously Hank and Jeff, do receive of a bit of Sort of funding from stacks, to assist with the development of Bns, I imagine.

Larry Salibra: Don't any funny from sex, totally independent.

Snazzy: Really says completely voluntary.

Larry Salibra: Yeah. It's completely. Yeah, I have a company, you're running. I need to figure out how to make a return on my and turn on my own investment and so, …

Snazzy: Okay.

Larry Salibra: if that's being asked, I'll do that. if I can't, I'll go do that through stripe, I mean, it's like,…

Snazzy: All right. Yeah.

Larry Salibra: I mean, that's personally in stacks, right? The companies in facts are designed here, but I don't get any funding from the foundation like that, I used to work for the years ago, right? But

Snazzy: So we've got bigger problem than I thought,…

Larry Salibra: So that's the prime minister,…

Snazzy: then that's

Larry Salibra: I guess. the difference between other ecosystems in here is that we're totally separate, there's no control. I don't get a paycheck from anybody, I mean, I guess my own company, but I sign them right, so it's just moving money from one side to the other. So I'm here because I care about this. I'm invest in stacks, nothing, eos system. I really wanted to go forward and I totally see the problems that you're saying here my perspective, this discussion about a Treasury Adele, I talk to this about other people in the community for a couple years and the issue is that I don't like there needs to be someone that doesn't right there needs to be that someone

Larry Salibra: As the gun exmark and the fact of their head for the regulators, So if you're gonna do it and you're gonna do a token sale, again asked, Right? Then someone needs to do that if I had interested in doing that, I would have done it many times over and over and over, And wouldn't be saying here, but it's just not something I'm interested because of the regulatory risk. So that mean. Used to be like, Okay, I'm going to raise money for a foundation, And promise to the people getting money, they're going to get XYZ out of it, And I'm gonna manage the money and hire people to manage this team, And so the question is who is going to do that and someone needs to do that. And right, so I talked about the last call is my view of how this is developed which turns turning out. Not to be the case was that people would figure out how to build businesses using Bns. just how Cloudflare sort of contributes to DNS development right? Then these businesses be like Bns is critical to my business. of course I'm gonna

Larry Salibra: Put one engineer on the Linux kernel, but it turned out that they've become speculative assets right?

Cordy Joseph: Right.

Larry Salibra: And people and so It's played out different that I yeah.

00:25:00

Snazzy: Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. speculation is that there are speculation in the DNS world and any other sort of naming system all

Larry Salibra: But yes, don't fund DNS developments and they don't play pretty much they're just Causing problem.

Snazzy: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: I mean they provide to liquidity perhaps for names so, you…

Snazzy: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: Right after they don't actually create technology. They don't like. I mean Yeah,…

Snazzy: Yeah. It's very true.

Larry Salibra: it's a different. Yeah.

Snazzy: Yeah, it's very true. Yeah. Yeah, they don't really provide much value really other than obviously having a vested interest. And in Bns and it's development and obviously wanting to see progress. But this is why we have a council, definitely is now I think subsequent councils are perhaps not being very effective let's say. but we've got a fantastic council on board now. and for the Council as well, I think it's important for us to have a little bit of agility.

Snazzy: in being able to make decisions, between the nine of us, vote on things of which we have done, for instance with the recent brand refresh that was something that we voted and decided upon and it can be changed and tweaked But with regards to the whole Treasury idea. I mean we've definitely not spoken about a token cell, So I don't think that's ever going to discussion in our sort of chat. But yeah, with regards the Treasury, it wouldn't be fully managed.

Snazzy: So it wouldn't be fully managed by the Council. The idea I think behind that is that it would be managed between the Council and, the elected council, I must say, because we're not sort of self-elected. it's the community and that who has who gets to be in the Council and that is chosen on a quarterly basis. But yeah, it would be This is the hope it would be managed with the Stacks Foundation with Mitchell and other people that involved in the state's foundation. if we had this in place that's for instance, if we were somehow able to upgrade, let's say that the Bns core contract and when the Bns doubt was created last October. I think between,

Snazzy: Between then and now I think there was a huge exposure in registrations of Bns names and two stacks each. So that would have equated to about 400,000 stacks. That would have been in a Bns treasury, which we could have used all funding, to help fund marketing initiatives. To help fund this partnership and there is a cost involved. Obviously, I can't go into details and things. and hence, this is why we've been communicating with Tim. To assist us with the funding on that. So

Snazzy: Yeah, I think things would have moved a lot faster. I think, ultimately if we had some sort of treasury in place, and if we were able to manage those funds, responsibly with the help of Tax Foundation, as a cow manager, sort of backup if you like, Yeah, the crux of it is that everyone is incredibly passionate about it Bns. That's fantastic, but we're it's all voluntary and I honestly don't mind being a volunteer being on the Bns Council, but I think that the Bns to really progress and move forward and to accelerate its growth That we need to have funds in place. We need to have a treasury and we probably need to have a grant provision from the Science Foundation.

Cordy Joseph: All right.

Larry Salibra: …

Snazzy: I'm

Larry Salibra: I doesn't seem like, I'm just all interesting partnerships, but it seems like this, if you just make a product that has a killer use case, the other stuff's not important, People will come and I think that's just not what's happened blur? you're comparing this to people are speculating and trading him. but is anybody using for anything and I mean the answer is probably not and yeah.

00:30:00

Cordy Joseph: So I have an answer for that. So I create a telegram chat, I sent you a link to it,…

Larry Salibra: Yeah. Yeah, sure.

Cordy Joseph: Larry and I said Snazzy. So what's happening? I have the guys from 1we, he's in there now. so one W is a no-quote site, building tool it's currently being used for your naps.

Larry Salibra: Cool. Yeah.

Cordy Joseph: So now he's in a chat with us. On telegram and also have snazzy on there. I would have you in there because you're more technical, that could help us out.

Larry Salibra: Sure.

Cordy Joseph: And then I also have a company, I work for as well. So the thing now is that we got a quick utility in the best way to bring under businesses just to show that they have our sights on top of Bns. And that'd be a good little,…

Larry Salibra: Yeah, absolutely.

Cordy Joseph: way to learn them in. But hey, we're official. So let me know if you're interested in hopping on the telegram chat and bring this all together.

Larry Salibra: Yeah, since you want to put the link in the call chat, can we all join?

Cordy Joseph: Yes, I'll send you link now.

Cordy Joseph: but, Intelligence.

Snazzy: You yeah, yeah, probably brutal. Yeah. So Yeah, I think we covered those. Yes. And I guess is all the last thing I might, so agenda was the L2 to L1 solution. Do you sort of received a sort of a progress update from Hank Larry. It's all

Larry Salibra: I've seen a bit but I'm not sure actually what I'm supposed to share. So I think that I'll say that I don't have a progress upgrade as of right now. But I know he's written something up. I don't know I've seen it but I'm not sure if it's supposed to be shared or not. So the progress is that there is progressing,…

Snazzy: Okay.

Larry Salibra: there's a plan. It's been written up, but I'm not sure what I think it's still discussion days.

Snazzy: Yeah, I think delunes also made a very good point as well.

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

Snazzy: just, Yeah, whether we're able to these calls weekly.

Larry Salibra: I'm happy to I get people didn't seem to, I was like, originally, the trouble is scheduling, These calls that I was trying to get down. In fact, the reason we have this time is because Ken from extra secular tent and we've seen how many times attended. And also also mark this was the time to overlap for him. Came from. X-person Mark from Hero Walt, they were both gonna get a call at the same time.

Snazzy: I see.

Larry Salibra: And unfortunately, I don't know. There's Dave other stuff going on. I'm happy to set this up weekly, or someone else is welcome to Also take the lead and lead it weekly. I mean the problem is I'm not sure I can. there's just because It's like Those matters.

Snazzy: Yeah. Yes. Length is

Larry Salibra: Yeah, yeah, it's like 11:30. 11 7 1107 right now.

Larry Salibra: But yeah, I mean if it's useful we could do it weekly. I mean what do you need? I mean I can just recurring the schedule to your weekly. It requires a bit of overhead. I haven't done. I have to posting the mean notes and stuff like that. I just want to make sure it's useful real time as opposed to just having because,…

Snazzy: Yeah, absolutely.

Larry Salibra: it's next Thursday is coming pretty quickly. I know, Hank's traveling this weekend I think through the weekend. So I need to catch up with them and it's really a question of how much more we have to talk about in Thursday.

Snazzy: Yeah. True.

Snazzy: Yeah, that's true.

Larry Salibra: So, I might,…

Larry Salibra: Especially since a lot of people who I would like to get to join. they have Gina's super busy, right? she's got and so if we make it every week,…

Cordy Joseph: but,

Larry Salibra: but I think that if you have a call relief,…

Snazzy: Yeah. Yeah.

Larry Salibra: But you should definitely do that. But if it's useful for Join. I want to minimize because every week is like you're already over time you end up going for about an hour each time usually. So that's Be great. That's a lot of time for months. Right, for people that are doing other stuff.

Snazzy: Yeah.

Snazzy: Yeah, agreed. Yeah, it's not. Yeah. Yeah,…

Larry Salibra: We knew that you have a job,…

Larry Salibra: right? Usually,

Snazzy: should be working right now, but

Larry Salibra: is it related to Bns

Snazzy: It's not. No, no. I'm a BDM for a tech company.

Larry Salibra: Okay.

Snazzy: So hence,…

Larry Salibra: Okay.

Snazzy: before I started I'm just really wanted to drive the partnerships but for Bns. So that's why me and Tommy have really just gone for the UD and we've been communicating with our BDM and

Larry Salibra: I'm sorry, it's Ud. The guy in here.

Snazzy: Unstoppable, the mains.

Larry Salibra: okay,…

00:35:00

Larry Salibra: the silica people right originally

Snazzy: Yeah. yeah,…

Snazzy: that Yeah,…

3 id: A polygon, I think the wrong polygon.

Snazzy: that's it.

Larry Salibra: Cool.

Snazzy: Yeah, yeah.

Larry Salibra: Do you who did that The Wizard guy? I was like,…

3 id: No.

Snazzy: that's,

3 id: That would be good.

Larry Salibra: why I know I've been away from the Internet. A lot this month. But moving and stuff but what he started

Snazzy: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I know I do hate abbreviations at times because it's just like you can just abbreviate everything but yeah no yeah unstoppable,…

Larry Salibra: Cool.

Snazzy: domains? Yeah we've been communicating with them for Feels like two months now. Yeah. It's taking such a long time. But again, if we had our own part of money, if we had our own treasury, we probably would have finalized this two or three weeks ago. It will cost.

Larry Salibra: Are they looking for money from you?

Snazzy: Yeah, there is a cost associated with it. Yeah, yeah.

Larry Salibra: Aren't they selling names why do they want money?

Snazzy: again I can't go into the details of it, but

3 id: Their integration.

Larry Salibra: Sounds really sketchy. But anyway,…

Snazzy: There's no sketchy.

Snazzy: No, it's absolutely not sketchy,…

Larry Salibra: No, never. Okay.

Snazzy: It's absolutely huge for Bns and the stacks as well because it could open up doors for stacks to also get integrated into wallets and exchanges. And all sorts of stuff so it's amazing opportunity, and this is why I do get a little bit annoyed.

Snazzy: Sometimes I feel like the blinkers are on with this with stacks with the leadership and there's such a focus,…

Larry Salibra: There is no,…

Snazzy: right? Okay.

Larry Salibra: there is no leadership. So if you keep looking Find it.

Snazzy: I know, I struggles. to refer to a refer to it, but there are people that have Okay,…

Larry Salibra: I mean, the Bitcoin leadership. It's the same way.

Snazzy: there are people with strong opinions that decide the direction let's say and they're very much focused on as sbtc right now which is completely understandable.

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

Snazzy: Yeah, that's completely understandable and it's going to be a fantastic thing for stacks. however, my feeling is that Bns and this partnership with Ud. is going to bring far more adoption near to

Snazzy: That's what I believe. Anyway, than I think sbc. Sptc definitely has an amazing use case. And it's incredibly important for sex. But for adoption,…

Larry Salibra: Yes. Yes.

Snazzy: for driving growth and adoption of the network are me. This partnership with Ed is essential Really, in my opinion.

3 id: I think as well to pick up.

Larry Salibra: I mean you commence me. Good.

3 id: So, sorry, I was gonna pick up on a point. You maybe about, Bns and a killer use case, it may not be there, And I think you're right, that people aren't really using at the moment, but the whole explosion of the bitcoin ecosystems happening right now. And the inevitability of using something like an L2 and…

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

3 id: the inevitability of that being stacks. Once, sbts it sees in, right? I listen to that manibu and it all makes sense, right? It's not probably that usable the block times, are short enough until sptc comes in, but if we wait until then to do anything with Bns, we're not ready.

Larry Salibra: Too late. Yeah.

3 id: The second the defy summer comes in for Bitcoin like it did for humans, sort of how I see it moving. Then it becomes very useful. then, it's got all of the NSS functionality, right? Because people start using the addresses to move the assets def to do everything. So You can almost mirror killer, use case against what the big domain naming services are doing in at the…

Cordy Joseph: Description.

3 id: Yeah, we've got some speculators and we've got some people playing within whatever. But assuming Bitcoin does what we think is going to do, which we're getting very strong signals in the market right now. It will come and…

Larry Salibra: Absolutely.

3 id: we need to be ready is my position on everything.

Snazzy: Yeah, I agree. I'm with that. I do have to shoot off now and actually do some works out. Nice to meet you, Larry.

Larry Salibra: Okay guys. One quick question for you I wanted to make sure I understand snazzy Bns council. I want to figure out whoever is affiliated related here. So I know who I'm talking to that way. I can have a view of The community. Quickly. Okay.

Snazzy: Yeah, so I'm Three is Bns Council. Tommy's Cordy's bns council and…

Larry Salibra: Okay.

Snazzy: tell you Deloonism is moderator. and has 10,000 bns names.

Larry Salibra: Sorry about the whole one account per name.

Snazzy: The delivery is deloon isn't Bns whale basically. 11k Williams got 11k.

Cordy Joseph: 11.

Larry Salibra: That's awesome. I'm so excited.

Snazzy: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: I'm really happy that you guys took the time to come and talk and I get the message and my life here is sorting out finally. and so hopefully I can dedicate more time to this. I mean, because this is being bns of brought me to what became stacks initially before I joined them. And I just have a place for my heart. So I want to like now that now there are other people that care about it. It's great because I felt for it was only. So,

00:40:00

3 id: Right. …

Snazzy: Yeah.

3 id: within our Larry, we're all here.

Snazzy: That's it.

Larry Salibra: Okay.

Snazzy: Yeah we're all here. we've turned up where we're passionate Bns investors and we just want to see it move forward and we just want to accelerate things and…

Larry Salibra: Okay.

Snazzy: and make Bns as big as ens, and Bigger than es exactly. Yeah.

Larry Salibra: Bigger.

3 id: Big.

Larry Salibra: The B meets bigger, the big beanies.

Cordy Joseph: And Larry that the thing they would not show is very eye-opening for me, too. I was like, Wow, you can't business and multiple apps. That's what I was like, Okay, I see a lot of use cases because it,…

Larry Salibra: That's awesome.

Cordy Joseph: if you could been bns to nostril, you could bring me in this to any app that you use and have that big facts wallet added to and…

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

Cordy Joseph: I'm like, this is good opportunity.

Larry Salibra: That's awesome guys. Useful

3 id: Larry's. Do you have any and either? it's difficult with the Use it model. Do you have any? Dialogue with Manib and the reason I ask is just because, I don't know where the people who are At the forefront of development. Shall we say the stacks, where they sit on bns, what they think of it? I saw a comment if he's on Twitter recently where he referred Jack Dorsey to As Dot SATs name for Northern, and I don't know…

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

3 id: if that was too in Chico, I reach out to him regularly on comments and stuff but he doesn't know who I am. He never responds. I just like to get

Larry Salibra: He's very supportive and I think it's just, he's pulling it and multiple directions. I got a lot has played and I think if we as the community deliver something that makes sense like sealers and I'm having chat with people on stage but good to see you snazzy. I'm gonna stop the call and that's not the recording too, just so you can talk without recording a little bit there. I think that he would be more I imagine you talk to him. I just saw him in Hong Kong, he was here a month and a half ago. had lunch…

3 id: Okay.

Larry Salibra: but he loved Bns very supportive. It just did like that. I mean I don't equal the leadership but sort of the team that he's face the people at Hero, the core developers and also sort of

Larry Salibra: Miniva also as well they're from their PhD backgrounds and they're very interested in hard technical problems. strong and…

3 id: Right.

Larry Salibra: and so the current hard technical problem. They're focusing on is svdc and I think that, and if that doesn't mean that they don't support Bns, it just means that they're focused on Sbtc and that's where the time goes and his,…

Cordy Joseph: He?

Larry Salibra: his personality is very much figure out the one thing it is. You need to focus on to move the ball forward and that's what he does. He's very good at doing that. But that doesn't mean he doesn't more bns to happen, right? It's just that he's not focused on that.

3 id: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

Larry Salibra: So I know he'd be very supportive. I'm just chatting with them. I might chat with my signal every once a while. I know he'd be very supportive. Basically, anything just be asked for he thinks it's critical. I mean I get some messages from her about it. he wants to see that one. L to integration like all these different things? Is that helpful, the answer.

3 id: Not really is. it's good to know people have lines into each other and just interesting. Can I ask we're here what's your position? within the ecosystem, firstly, I've heard of you and seen you around, we've been at these talks and I sort of more involved. I don't know…

Larry Salibra: Again.

3 id: where you sit within all of that and also, What? You'd like to see happen to be in this over the next few months. I know we've had extended discussions around, how many addresses per wallet and whatever the architecture of Bns V2 is and there are multiple moving parts.

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

3 id: But I've never really got chance to chat with you about what your vision of that is.

Larry Salibra: I mean, where I am is that so I didn't think with Noster early this year because I just think that the thing way to move forward is to use cases but where does Bns make sense? and the whole we're gonna use these names to send money. I mean, that's gone around for at least 10 years any other long time and every other

3 id: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: Send bitcoins names and that's literally how this project got started in 2013 or 14, so it's sort of some people use it. It's never really that killer use case and maybe it will some day or maybe I don't see it. so I just wanted to I mean, the master thing was sort of like, how can I make something relatively a few weeks project and throw something out there and see if I've been Get some interested DNS. It's like a situation where they severely need names and they're also Bitcoin focused right

00:45:00

3 id: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: So it's almost perfect. The problem is they're all militant maxies that was problematic. so I'm thinking about use cases and I have some other potential use cases of my sleeves which obviously, but now that I might like to sort of like, getting calming down here with

Larry Salibra: Other support other personal stuff. I'd like to try to get those things out in the next few months or weeks I mean I don't want to invest one,…

3 id: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: I want to figure out which one stick. and sort of beta ray on that and try to build something that's useful for people. I mean I really just want to build stuff that's seasonal people and I may get an officer thing another try with another so many different take.

3 id: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: No growing works. I see, they still have not had names like, Jack Dorsey has given up on the original name just in there using, which is based on domain names So. I think that there's a bunch of different places you can sort of head for and…

3 id: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: I had to talk with Gina back. Sometime last year about Hey, What was her view? Do you think it's more useful to

Larry Salibra: Basically You guys are think about how you do great now marketing and driving gas forward or anything. It's more useful to figure out use cases for it. And sort of the conclusion we came. I was like, if you have use cases by all means use cases, right? Because …

3 id: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: because you can use cases if they're compelling, they become the marketing. But …

3 id: Yeah. Agreed.

Larry Salibra: but if you're just doing marketing and he would dns bns just being with the same but we're in Bitcoin. Then it's different. I'm not saying it's bad. it's probably less effective. Than being I've come up with this thing and that's like everybody needs names for this.

3 id: It's almost as if I yourself in a position because you're in a different chain, if stuff comes to bitcoin like defying, whatever, there's almost a market expectation that you have the functionality being it, it's not impressive,…

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

3 id: you're right. You'll come for it but when they arrive, if you have a really subpar version of the NS and then the killer thing, It's almost like you need to do both.

Cordy Joseph: Here and…

Larry Salibra: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

Cordy Joseph: it's crazy the best use case for Bns is that's a domains of gaming. I've been around NFC Washington's and domains between 19 but Dr. Domains and…

Larry Salibra: I'm sorry Dick Demon or…

Cordy Joseph: It's gaming.

Larry Salibra: domain, I'm sorry to Manian.

Cordy Joseph: That's the best use case for lack of money.

Larry Salibra: gaming.

Cordy Joseph: Yes, because now if you can add things like chats inside these games, you have a killer thing was that you have the game you have to ID for the gamer, but you'll have a boyfriend to chat inside the game and so my thing right now is the best use case for domains is going to be gaming. And that's actually bring up the fortnite example, and all that. Because also there's a guy know

Larry Salibra: it's like I did identity for people in games we say gaming.

Cordy Joseph: That's thing like this identity for people in games. And then ultimately these are…

Larry Salibra: Mmm.

Cordy Joseph: because the NFC and games can be the skins. So now you have a way to attack skins. So there's this gaming characters, identities. And then you go even talk and have a nostril app within the game. So now you have multiple all at once.

Larry Salibra: Yeah.

Cordy Joseph: And but there's not a lot talks around gaming for stacks, and I feel like we definitely need to talk more about gaming how to implement these tools and to gaming applications.

Larry Salibra: Yes, sir.

3 id: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: I think it's a cultural thing. I mean, the problem is, you talk to me. I bought it a Nintendo switch during covid. I played Super Mario, but that's about things. And when you talk about gaming, I mean, I'm not in the culture. So it's really hard for me. Eve's not a gamer. I mean, I don't think I could be in early stacks people that are gamers. And that's why you don't see we start not to do it, so we need from who have that background to bring that to the community and

Cordy Joseph: Yeah, so that's the guy. I know that actually bought him to be a The discord chat. He's building a game of what he's gonna have.

3 id: Will.

Cordy Joseph: An AI chat feature inside the game, but I told you could Bns within the game as well. So that's a great thing that I see the use case for is that he could have it gamers identities within that realm and…

Larry Salibra: He?

00:50:00

Cordy Joseph: and connected to a sign in to Bns kind of thing. And I feel like we butcher in my opinion. but it's called Bionic House. The Game Bionic Owls. wls. Yes.

Larry Salibra: By myself.

3 id: Do you know much about? what film Philip is up to Larry Phillip.x, CK, Dot app is in the stacks. Bns channel, on discord and is working Some I use brought to my attention when I was asking about subdomains and he's seems to be using a subdomain as of an adult app bns. This is using him and I'm trying to post this picture to you, but I can't. When I asked him about it, I thought he was producing a guide. I asked him for an update and he said Right now working on it, trying to finish it ASAP, Just to hint. It could become a very powerful single sign on infrastructure for thousands of apps. Not only stocks apps.

Cordy Joseph: I like that. I love the idea of a single sign on. That's a very few stage.

3 id: So, I don't know…

Cordy Joseph: Remember, you could add that and you

3 id: you've spoken with that. That's pretty big. Let me try and ping this. Attach your photo, I'll take it over journey anyway Larry, it's some in some ways I want to know if you knew him or if he was involved with any team that

Larry Salibra: I sort of know him And I've seen her own. I can't remember. I couldn't tell you exactly what he's working on. I guess that it decides of the community has gotten too big to sort of know what.

3 id: Okay.

Larry Salibra: Everybody is working on and most people don't use their faces and they're real.

3 id: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: Yeah, I do know Philip, I know who you're talking about, I just can't remember. And I'm really bad at Discording license anybody's ever notice. It's not bad. I am a gaming. It's just like, I'm too old now. I don't know.

3 id: It's an overnight, man. It's all that anyway. if that's great, I just watch out because apparently something's coming soon and that sounds I don't know how much sauce you'll sign on Ens or…

Larry Salibra: Cool.

3 id: people can do. I know everyone, I'll be working on it but I don't see a lot of it proliferating outside of Web 3 but if it seems like he suggesting this and thousands of apps so could be huge, could be what we're looking for.

Cordy Joseph: A little, I would love to hear more about that because a single silent is definitely right in the bubble of what I envisioned Bns to be. so remember,…

3 id: Yeah.

Cordy Joseph: look at, I could Need blockchain. It could be any location but that's log into any app is not bns.

3 id: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: I mean, so I wrote the original, single sign-in with being with Venus forever, though, right? And that's like the sign language stacks now. But he have funny, is that we use the word past he spend years ago, but now with the Web browsers are going past keys, right now, that's now getting pushed right? And I mean personally I think that's like Blockchain independent, right? It's just public drug key and…

3 id: Right.

Larry Salibra: that's going to build all your platforms, apple shipping it android everywhere. it seems to be in a couple of years, our alternative things, the things that we made were cool at the time You're just gonna built into your device with your secure hardware, not to be out,…

3 id: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: that's Like, do you guys see something different than that?

3 id: No, no, you mentioned, I had sort of heard twinkling of that but I hadn't had sort of forgotten it. So I don't know if he's building something different, a lot of it's that and It just seemed exciting but you might be right. You might be a sort of PRECURS at what's coming anyway.

Larry Salibra: Yeah, I just don't know the details but yeah, I think about is that what we need to not even with stacks are also bitcoin. It's like we're not just competing with other crypto tokens, right? We're also competing. We just like the normal world for example,…

3 id: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: for Bitcoin, payments have gotten amazing, just centralized payments. I live in Hong Kong and you go to any store and they have a sticker, before it was like these ambassador card. there's so many There's 30 different logos. There's so many different payment networks.

3 id: Over there. Yeah.

Larry Salibra: They is out of control. and so in bitcoin or reinstacks or whatever we have to compete with those. Eventually too.

Cordy Joseph: And for me the whole ghost. But a tool. That's like the middleman. we don't have to come. That's the thing, that's it weightless, all. And I was and make it scalable and make it massive and easy for everyone to use. That because everyone's building a payment system.

Larry Salibra: Mmm.

Cordy Joseph: So what's gonna help drive these penis systems?

00:55:00

Larry Salibra: Goods and services.

Cordy Joseph: Yeah.

Larry Salibra: Okay guys, I got to rocks really but I appreciate really all of you coming to spend time here and share because I love your passion and it's really motivates me because it's really exciting to see people passionate about technology care about and so this go forward I'll try to catch up with a couple people early next week. And maybe we're going to start it every week next week. But then, at the next meeting, we can try to give people a bit of notice. So, we're gonna try to do some more frequently, if it seems like it makes sense and then go for there.

3 id: It definitely seems nice touch base.

Cordy Joseph: Butcher.

3 id: I guess we need a bit of flexibility here but we're all super up for it. I'm talking about this on discord every day. So if you operate Larry where we're good to go, I think

Larry Salibra: Cool sounds great. And so I just follow you. Three Dot ID. Do you have a name or? Is that your name? I just call you through diet.

3 id: Yeah, that's good. Let's go with that. I'm sure if ever we meet at a conference at all, fall over. But for now, I'm quite enjoying it.

Larry Salibra: Okay, cool. And you've upgraded. The name is all good.

3 id: yeah, yeah, we're good.

Larry Salibra: Okay, I worry about the diabetes. Okay. Okay,…

3 id: Thanks for the show.

Larry Salibra: take care later.

3 id: It's on bad.
