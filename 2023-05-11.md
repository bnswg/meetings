## Points discussed

- How to implement the upgrade: should the 2.0 contract be upgradable? If so, how are those upgrade decisions made?
- Multiple names per account: Is the account that owns the name the identity the name refers to or is it the value the name points at?
- How to fund this project going forward: DAO? collect registration fees instead of burning?
- Name pricing: should we change the core price of .btc? Can we enable pricing of names in different currencies? ie. sBTC
