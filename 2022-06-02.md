# BNSWG 2022-06-02 1400-1500 UTC

**Attendees:** Larry Salibra, Phillip, Yukan Liao, Werner, Hero G, Marvin Janssen

## Agenda

- Upgrade path for BNS
- Creation of a SIP proposal to fix existing bugs
- Other business

## Upgrade path for BNS

We discussed the options: hark-forking the existing contract with Stacks 2.1 vs deploying a new contract and getting other people to use it. As a lot of things are hardcoded to the current contract address, the general consensus seemed to be hardforking was the better method.

## Proposing a SIP to fix problems with existing BNS contract

Larry proposed these items to be included in a proposed:

- name-renewal should burn fees https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-blockchain/issues/2973
- name-renewal should transfer name to new owner (it appears not to do this now - Mark mentioned this is a known issue but I havenâ€™t verified it myself)
- multiple names per account
- conform to SIP-0009 NFT standard

### Discussion:

- Multiple names per contract is allowed already if you include subdomains
- One participant is launching a service that gives the subdomain on bns to the owner of the same ICANN subdomain
- Pricing of namespaces is too rigid: it prevents use cases like Chile's NIC buying .cl and selling names with their ICANN names.
- Why don't we have a voting contract for BNS? We have this for stacks. (Discussed in relationship to the inflexibility of name/namespace pricing)
- The intent of proposing these bug fixes / non-controversial changes is to start a discussion about what we want for BNS in the future.

## Other business

### Xverse wants to make it so that you can send bitcoin to a BNS name.

- Discussed proposing a SIP vs unilaterally coming up with their own format.
- We talked about how hypothetically in the future it might make sense for standards that only relate to BNS to go through BNSIP process separate from the SIP process.

- Larry mentioned that we previously had support for adding a bitcoin (or other addresses) to profiles. This is from [larry.id's profile](https://gaia.blockstack.org/hub/1fHF3QADKT62js8BqHXmF31CFA1KUcTud/0/profile.json) and how it was previously done:

```json
{
  "identifier": "1EyuZ8qxdhHjcnTChwQLyQaN3cmdK55DkH",
  "role": "payment",
  "@type": "Account",
  "service": "bitcoin",
  "placeholder": false
}
```

### Discussed about using BNS via bitcoin.

- Prior to Stacks 2.0 you could registered some names with only BTC
- We agree that BNS should be more tightly tied to bitcoin
- We liked the idea of making BNS the best name system it can be for bitcoin.
- It's unclear if we still register .ids with only bitcoin
- Discussed the possibility of two approaches to tying BNS more closely to bitcoin
  1.  Making it so that certain namespaces require you to send/burn some BTC to register a name in that namespace
  2.  Make it possible to register names only through bitcoin without having to interact with stacks nodes at all - using something similar to the Stacks 1.0 OP_RETURN format. These names would exist in stacks nodes as well. It's unclear if stacks would be able to read them with current functionality today

### Action items:

- Separate controversial items in a separate SIP: multiple names per account was the only controversial item we found
- ask Friedger:
  - if he's encountered any other bugs in the BNS smart contract
  - using BNS with bitcoin, ask about SIP process
- ask Jude about ability to register .id names with bitcoin
